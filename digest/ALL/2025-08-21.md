## 1. Privileged Self-Access Matters for Introspection in AI
- **Authors**: Siyuan Song, Harvey Lederman, Jennifer Hu, Kyle Mahowald

- **Abstract**:
> Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined. Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any process which yields information about internal states through a process more reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

## 2. Data-Driven Probabilistic Evaluation of Logic Properties with PAC-Confidence on Mealy Machines
- **Authors**: Swantje Plambeck, Ali Salamati, Eyke Huellermeier, Goerschwin Fey
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14710](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14710)
- **Abstract**:
> Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

- **Authors**: Ziyang Luo, Zhiqi Shen, Wenzhuo Yang, Zirui Zhao, Prathyusha Jwalapuram, Amrita Saha, Doyen Sahoo, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Junnan Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14704](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14704)
- **Abstract**:
> The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.

## 4. Entropy-Constrained Strategy Optimization in Urban Floods: A Multi-Agent Framework with LLM and Knowledge Graph Integration
- **Authors**: Peilin Ji, Xiao Xue, Simeng Wang, Wenhao Yan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14654)
- **Abstract**:
> In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions, threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation) requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency. Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware, knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban flood response.

## 5. LeanGeo: Formalizing Competitional Geometry problems in Lean
- **Authors**: Chendong Song, Zihan Wang, Frederick Pu, Haiming Wang, Xiaohan Lin, Junqi Liu, Jia Li, Zhengying Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14644](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14644)
- **Abstract**:
> Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields. Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of LeanGeo at this https URL.

## 6. Who Sees What? Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs
- **Authors**: Luca Annese, Sabrina Patania, Silvia Serino, Tom Foulsham, Silvia Rossi, Azzurra Ruggeri, Dimitri Ognibene
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths (E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action'' examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

## 7. The Agent Behavior: Model, Governance and Challenges in the AI Digital Age
- **Authors**: Qiang Zhang, Pei Yan, Yijia Xu, Chuanpo Fu, Yong Fang, Yang Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14415](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14415)
- **Abstract**:
> Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6 stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity (HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency, intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns. The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

## 8. Automated Optimization Modeling through Expert-Guided Large Language Model Reasoning
- **Authors**: Beinuo Yang, Qishen Zhou, Junyi Li, Xingchen Su, Simon Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14410](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14410)
- **Abstract**:
> Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations: high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes, providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization modeling.

## 9. Quantization Meets dLLMs: A Systematic Study of Post-training Quantization for Diffusion LLMs
- **Authors**: Haokun Lin, Haobo Xu, Yichen Wu, Ziyu Guo, Renrui Zhang, Zhichao Lu, Ying Wei, Qingfu Zhang, Zhenan Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14896](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14896)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and experimental setups will be released to support the community.

## 10. Graph Structure Learning with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck for Inductive Representation Learning
- **Authors**: Jiafeng Xiong, Rizos Sakellariou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14859](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14859)
- **Abstract**:
> Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges: effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization. GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets; they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting, with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

## 11. $TIME[t] \subseteq SPACE[O(\sqrt{t})]$ via Tree Height Compression
- **Authors**: Logan Nye
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14831](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14831)
- **Abstract**:
> We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing machines, showing $\TIME[t] \subseteq \SPACE[O(\sqrt{t})]$. The key step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log T)$ for $T = \lceil t/b \rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ work at leaves, $O(1)$ at internal nodes, and edges that are logspace-checkable; semantic correctness across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ window replay at the unique interface. The proof uses midpoint (balanced) recursion, a per-path potential that bounds simultaneously active interfaces by $O(\log T)$, and an indegree-capping replacement of multiway merges by balanced binary combiners. Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming, ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b + \log(t/b))$ for block sizes $b \ge b_0$ with $b_0 = \Theta(\log t)$, which at the canonical choice $b = \Theta(\sqrt{t})$ gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space; the $b_0$ threshold rules out degenerate blocks where addressing scratch would dominate the window footprint. The construction is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$ bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for $\SPACE[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and $O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models.

## 12. Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Across Languages
- **Authors**: Josh Barua, Seun Eisape, Kayo Yin, Alane Suhr
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14828](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14828)
- **Abstract**:
> Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen 2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third, data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

## 13. From Passive Tool to Socio-cognitive Teammate: A Conceptual Framework for Agentic AI in Human-AI Collaborative Learning
- **Authors**: Lixiang Yan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14825)
- **Abstract**:
> The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid transformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool towards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This shift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of proactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual framework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI interaction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel conceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of escalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an Adaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a Co-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural theories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this framework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and responsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a critical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration, examining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared intentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while AI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed as a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda for AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning environments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.

## 14. Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation vs. Long-Context Input for Clinical Reasoning over EHRs
- **Authors**: Skatje Myers, Dmitriy Dligach, Timothy A. Miller, Samantha Barr, Yanjun Gao, Matthew Churpek, Anoop Mayampurath, Majid Afshar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14817](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14817)
- **Abstract**:
> Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2) generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

## 15. TransLight: Image-Guided Customized Lighting Control with Generative Decoupling
- **Authors**: Zongming Li, Lianghui Zhu, Haocheng Shen, Longjin Ran, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14814](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14814)
- **Abstract**:
> Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets, injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal. The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination harmonization and editing.

## 16. DINOv3 with Test-Time Training for Medical Image Registration
- **Authors**: Shansong Wang, Mojtaba Safari, Mingzhe Hu, Qiang Li, Chih-Wei Chang, Richard LJ Qiu, Xiaofeng Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14809](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14809)
- **Abstract**:
> Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks, the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general solution for clinical registration without additional training.

## 17. TransLLM: A Unified Multi-Task Foundation Framework for Urban Transportation via Learnable Prompting
- **Authors**: Jiaming Leng, Yunying Bi, Chuan Qin, Bing Yin, Yanyong Zhang, Chao Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14782](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14782)
- **Abstract**:
> Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations, dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at this https URL.

## 18. PepThink-R1: LLM for Interpretable Cyclic Peptide Optimization with CoT SFT and Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Ruheng Wang, Hang Zhang, Trieu Nguyen, Shasha Feng, Hao-Wei Pang, Xiang Yu, Li Xiao, Peter Zhiping Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14765](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14765)
- **Abstract**:
> Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

## 19. Reliable generation of isomorphic physics problems using ChatGPT with prompt-chaining and tool use
- **Authors**: Zhongzhou Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14755](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14755)
- **Abstract**:
> We present a method for generating large numbers of isomorphic physics problems using ChatGPT through prompt chaining and tool use. This approach enables precise control over structural variations-such as numeric values and spatial relations-while supporting diverse contextual variations in the problem body. By utilizing the Python code interpreter, the method supports automatic solution validation and simple diagram generation, addressing key limitations in existing LLM-based methods. We generated two example isomorphic problem banks and compared the outcome against simpler prompt-based approaches. Results show that prompt-chaining produces significantly higher quality and more consistent outputs than simpler, non-chaining prompts. This work demonstrates a promising method for efficient problem creation accessible to the average instructor, which opens new possibilities for personalized adaptive testing and automated content development.

## 20. Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model
- **Authors**: Yunzhe Zhang, Yifei Wang, Khanh Vinh Nguyen, Pengyu Hong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14748](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14748)
- **Abstract**:
> Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities: molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

## 21. Evaluating Multilingual and Code-Switched Alignment in LLMs via Synthetic Natural Language Inference
- **Authors**: Samir Abdaljalil, Erchin Serpedin, Khalid Qaraqe, Hasan Kurban
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14735](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14735)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever for improving multilingual robustness.

## 22. AFABench: A Generic Framework for Benchmarking Active Feature Acquisition
- **Authors**: Valter Schütz, Han Wu, Reza Rezvan, Linus Aronsson, Morteza Haghir Chehreghani
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14734)
- **Abstract**:
> In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns. Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy, and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for future research. The benchmark code is available at: this https URL.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14725](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14725)
- **Abstract**:
> Recently, the Manna-Pnueli Hierarchy has been used to define the temporal logics LTLfp and PPLTLp, which allow to use finite-trace LTLf/PPLTL techniques in infinite-trace settings while achieving the expressiveness of full LTL. In this paper, we present the first actual solvers for reactive synthesis in these logics. These are based on games on graphs that leverage DFA-based techniques from LTLf/PPLTL to construct the game arena. We start with a symbolic solver based on Emerson-Lei games, which reduces lower-class properties (guarantee, safety) to higher ones (recurrence, persistence) before solving the game. We then introduce Manna-Pnueli games, which natively embed Manna-Pnueli objectives into the arena. These games are solved by composing solutions to a DAG of simpler Emerson-Lei games, resulting in a provably more efficient approach. We implemented the solvers and practically evaluated their performance on a range of representative formulas. The results show that Manna-Pnueli games often offer significant advantages, though not universally, indicating that combining both approaches could further enhance practical performance.

## 24. Transplant Then Regenerate: A New Paradigm for Text Data Augmentation
- **Authors**: Guangzhan Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Beijun Shen, Xiaodong Gu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14723](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14723)
- **Abstract**:
> Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing, which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs. The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover, LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data grows.

- **Authors**: Junying Chen, Zhenyang Cai, Zhiheng Liu, Yunjin Yang, Rongsheng Wang, Qingying Xiao, Xiangyi Feng, Zhan Su, Jing Guo, Xiang Wan, Guangjun Yu, Haizhou Li, Benyou Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14706](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14706)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2) the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking, listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

## 26. Learning in Repeated Multi-Objective Stackelberg Games with Payoff Manipulation
- **Authors**: Phurinut Srisawad, Juergen Branke, Long Tran-Thanh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14705](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14705)
- **Abstract**:
> We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games, where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives, is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility function.

## 27. Foe for Fraud: Transferable Adversarial Attacks in Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Authors**: Jan Lum Fok, Qingwen Zeng, Shiping Chen, Oscar Fawkes, Huaming Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14699](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14699)
- **Abstract**:
> Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is a critical application of Machine Learning (ML) in the financial sector, where accurately identifying fraudulent transactions is essential for mitigating financial losses. ML models have demonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with the tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in computer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly those trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These latent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability of the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses could be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic framework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial perturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based attack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data in both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm that tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners regarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments by transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to non-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate that such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing robust defenses for CCFD algorithms.

## 28. ECHO: Frequency-aware Hierarchical Encoding for Variable-length Signal
- **Authors**: Yucong Zhang, Juan Liu, Ming Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14689](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14689)
- **Abstract**:
> Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in vision and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling-covering acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored. Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN (this https URL), a newly introduced large-scale benchmark for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and fault identification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on this https URL.

## 29. ELATE: Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering
- **Authors**: Andrew Murray, Danial Dervovic, Michael Cashmore
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14667](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14667)
- **Abstract**:
> Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data. ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new, contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various domains.

## 30. OneLoc: Geo-Aware Generative Recommender Systems for Local Life Service
- **Authors**: Zhipeng Wei, Kuo Cai, Junda She, Jie Chen, Minghao Chen, Yang Zeng, Qiang Luo, Wencong Zeng, Ruiming Tang, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14646](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14646)
- **Abstract**:
> Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus, recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service, an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3) neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves 400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.

## 31. Can LLM Agents Solve Collaborative Tasks? A Study on Urgency-Aware Planning and Coordination
- **Authors**: João Vitor de Carvalho Silva, Douglas G. Macharet
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14635](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14635)
- **Abstract**:
> The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor, prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and architectural improvements.

## 32. A Study of the Scale Invariant Signal to Distortion Ratio in Speech Separation with Noisy References
- **Authors**: Simon Dahl Jepsen, Mads Græsbøll Christensen, Jesper Rindom Jensen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14623](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14623)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper examines the implications of using the Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) as both evaluation and training objective in supervised speech separation, when the training references contain noise, as is the case with the de facto benchmark WSJ0-2Mix. A derivation of the SI-SDR with noisy references reveals that noise limits the achievable SI-SDR, or leads to undesired noise in the separated outputs. To address this, a method is proposed to enhance references and augment the mixtures with WHAM!, aiming to train models that avoid learning noisy references. Two models trained on these enhanced datasets are evaluated with the non-intrusive NISQA.v2 metric. Results show reduced noise in separated speech but suggest that processing references may introduce artefacts, limiting overall quality gains. Negative correlation is found between SI-SDR and perceived noisiness across models on the WSJ0-2Mix and Libri2Mix test sets, underlining the conclusion from the derivation.

## 33. UST-SSM: Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Models for Point Cloud Video Modeling
- **Authors**: Peiming Li, Ziyi Wang, Yulin Yuan, Hong Liu, Xiangming Meng, Junsong Yuan, Mengyuan Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14604](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14604)
- **Abstract**:
> Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at this https URL.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14582)
- **Abstract**:
> Heterogeneous accelerator-centric compute clusters are emerging as efficient solutions for diverse AI workloads. However, current integration strategies often compromise data movement efficiency and encounter compatibility issues in hardware and software. This prevents a unified approach that balances performance and ease of use. To this end, we present SNAX, an open-source integrated HW-SW framework enabling efficient multi-accelerator platforms through a novel hybrid-coupling scheme, consisting of loosely coupled asynchronous control and tightly coupled data access. SNAX brings reusable hardware modules designed to enhance compute accelerator utilization, and its customizable MLIR-based compiler to automate key system management tasks, jointly enabling rapid development and deployment of customized multi-accelerator compute clusters. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate SNAX's efficiency and flexibility in a low-power heterogeneous SoC. Accelerators can easily be integrated and programmed to achieve > 10x improvement in neural network performance compared to other accelerator systems while maintaining accelerator utilization of > 90% in full system operation.

- **Authors**: Euiyeon Kim, Yong-Hoon Choi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14556](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14556)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce a new music source separation model tailored for accurate vocal isolation. Unlike Transformer-based approaches, which often fail to capture intermittently occurring vocals, our model leverages Mamba2, a recent state space model, to better capture long-range temporal dependencies. To handle long input sequences efficiently, we combine a band-splitting strategy with a dual-path architecture. Experiments show that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models, achieving a cSDR of 11.03 dB-the best reported to date-and delivering substantial gains in uSDR. Moreover, the model exhibits stable and consistent performance across varying input lengths and vocal occurrence patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-based models for high-resolution audio processing and open up new directions for broader applications in audio research.

## 36. Towards LLM-generated explanations for Component-based Knowledge Graph Question Answering Systems
- **Authors**: Dennis Schiese, Aleksandr Perevalov, Andreas Both
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14553](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14553)
- **Abstract**:
> Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components, enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations (automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF and SPARQL as a context for explanations.

## 37. Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty
- **Authors**: Zixi Chen, Yinyu Ye, Zijie Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544)
- **Abstract**:
> We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore, it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each request.
> We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler, highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

## 38. Post-hoc LLM-Supported Debugging of Distributed Processes
- **Authors**: Dennis Schiese, Andreas Both
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14540)
- **Abstract**:
> In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems. Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations. These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes. Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely accessible to all users.

## 39. Beyond ReLU: Chebyshev-DQN for Enhanced Deep Q-Networks
- **Authors**: Saman Yazdannik, Morteza Tayefi, Shamim Sanisales
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14536](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14536)
- **Abstract**:
> The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

- **Abstract**:
> We introduce EffiFusion-GAN (Efficient Fusion Generative Adversarial Network), a lightweight yet powerful model for speech enhancement. The model integrates depthwise separable convolutions within a multi-scale block to capture diverse acoustic features efficiently.

Additionally, dynamic pruning is applied to reduce model size while maintaining performance, making the framework suitable for resource-constrained environments.

## 41. MISS: Multi-Modal Tree Indexing and Searching with Lifelong Sequential Behavior for Retrieval Recommendation
- **Authors**: Chengcheng Guo, Junda She, Kuo Cai, Shiyao Wang, Qigen Hu, Qiang Luo, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14515](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14515)
- **Abstract**:
> Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand, lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information, potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for multi-perspective interests searching.

## 42. PB-IAD: Utilizing multimodal foundation models for semantic industrial anomaly detection in dynamic manufacturing environments
- **Authors**: Bernd Hofmann, Albert Scheck, Joerg Franke, Patrick Bruendl
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14504](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14504)
- **Abstract**:
> The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions. Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions. Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance, particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely through semantic instructions.

## 43. Exact Shapley Attributions in Quadratic-time for FANOVA Gaussian Processes
- **Authors**: Majid Mohammadi, Krikamol Muandet, Ilaria Tiddi, Annette Ten Teije, Siu Lun Chau
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14499](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14499)
- **Abstract**:
> Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features, severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only, capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic) Möbius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable, axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions generated by structured probabilistic models.

## 44. Synaptic bundle theory for spike-driven sensor-motor system: More than eight independent synaptic bundles collapse reward-STDP learning
- **Authors**: Takeshi Kobayashi, Shogo Yonekura, Yasuo Kuniyoshi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14492](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14492)
- **Abstract**:
> Neuronal spikes directly drive muscles and endow animals with agile movements, but applying the spike-based control signals to actuators in artificial sensor-motor systems inevitably causes a collapse of learning. We developed a system that can vary \emph{the number of independent synaptic bundles} in sensor-to-motor connections. This paper demonstrates the following four findings: (i) Learning collapses once the number of motor neurons or the number of independent synaptic bundles exceeds a critical limit. (ii) The probability of learning failure is increased by a smaller number of motor neurons, while (iii) if learning succeeds, a smaller number of motor neurons leads to faster learning. (iv) The number of weight updates that move in the opposite direction of the optimal weight can quantitatively explain these results. The functions of spikes remain largely unknown. Identifying the parameter range in which learning systems using spikes can be constructed will make it possible to study the functions of spikes that were previously inaccessible due to the difficulty of learning.

- **Abstract**:
> We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

- **Authors**: Haojun Zhuang, Dünya Baradari, Nataliya Kosmyna, Arnav Balyan, Constanze Albrecht, Stephanie Chen, Pattie Maes
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14442](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14442)
- **Abstract**:
> Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential (ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG + eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and accessibility.

## 48. Cognitive Surgery: The Awakening of Implicit Territorial Awareness in LLMs
- **Authors**: Yinghan Zhou, Weifeng Zhu, Juan Wen, Wanli Peng, Zhengxian Wu, Yiming Xue
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14408](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14408)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However, performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm (IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%, respectively.

## 49. NoteIt: A System Converting Instructional Videos to Interactable Notes Through Multimodal Video Understanding
- **Authors**: Running Zhao, Zhihan Jiang, Xinchen Zhang, Chirui Chang, Handi Chen, Weipeng Deng, Luyao Jin, Xiaojuan Qi, Xun Qian, Edith C.H. Ngai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14395](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14395)
- **Abstract**:
> Users often take notes for instructional videos to access key knowledge later without revisiting long videos. Automated note generation tools enable users to obtain informative notes efficiently. However, notes generated by existing research or off-the-shelf tools fail to preserve the information conveyed in the original videos comprehensively, nor can they satisfy users' expectations for diverse presentation formats and interactive features when using notes digitally. In this work, we present NoteIt, a system, which automatically converts instructional videos to interactable notes using a novel pipeline that faithfully extracts hierarchical structure and multimodal key information from videos. With NoteIt's interface, users can interact with the system to further customize the content and presentation formats of the notes according to their preferences. We conducted both a technical evaluation and a comparison user study (N=36). The solid performance in objective metrics and the positive user feedback demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipeline and the overall usability of NoteIt. Project website: this https URL

## 50. DEPTH: Hallucination-Free Relation Extraction via Dependency-Aware Sentence Simplification and Two-tiered Hierarchical Refinement
- **Authors**: Yupei Yang, Fan Feng, Lin Yang, Wanxi Deng, Lin Qu, Biwei Huang, Shikui Tu, Lei Xu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14391](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14391)
- **Abstract**:
> Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs, DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence, correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\% improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

## 51. Credence Calibration Game? Calibrating Large Language Models through Structured Play
- **Authors**: Ke Fang, Tianyi Zhao, Lu Cheng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14390](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14390)
- **Abstract**:
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance, our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at this https URL.

## 52. Online Incident Response Planning under Model Misspecification through Bayesian Learning and Belief Quantization
- **Authors**: Kim Hammar, Tao Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14385](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14385)
- **Abstract**:
> Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL: Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available, which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.

## 53. ZPD-SCA: Unveiling the Blind Spots of LLMs in Assessing Students' Cognitive Abilities
- **Authors**: Wenhan Dong, Zhen Sun, Yuemeng Zhao, Zifan Peng, Jun Wu, Jingyi Zheng, Yule Liu, Xinlei He, Yu Wang, Ruiming Wang, Xinyi Huang, Lei Mo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14377](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14377)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore, significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

## 54. Computing-In-Memory Dataflow for Minimal Buffer Traffic
- **Authors**: Choongseok Song, Doo Seok Jeong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14375](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14375)
- **Abstract**:
> Computing-In-Memory (CIM) offers a potential solution to the memory wall issue and can achieve high energy efficiency by minimizing data movement, making it a promising architecture for edge AI devices. Lightweight models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature extraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper. When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline (conventional weight-stationary dataflow).

## 55. Learning Point Cloud Representations with Pose Continuity for Depth-Based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation
- **Authors**: Zhujun Li, Shuo Zhang, Ioannis Stamos
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14358)
- **Abstract**:
> Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications.

## 56. Organ-Agents: Virtual Human Physiology Simulator via LLMs
- **Authors**: Rihao Chang, He Jiao, Weizhi Nie, Honglin Guo, Keliang Xie, Zhenhua Wu, Lina Zhao, Yunpeng Bai, Yongtao Ma, Lanjun Wang, Yuting Su, Xi Gao, Weijie Wang, Nicu Sebe, Bruno Lepri, Bingwei Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14357](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14357)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.

## 57. Inter-Class Relational Loss for Small Object Detection: A Case Study on License Plates
- **Authors**: Dian Ning, Dong Seog Han
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14343)
- **Abstract**:
> In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union (IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper, we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study: (1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance. We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6% in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

## 58. Generative AI Against Poaching: Latent Composite Flow Matching for Wildlife Conservation
- **Authors**: Lingkai Kong, Haichuan Wang, Charles A. Emogor, Vincent Börsch-Supan, Lily Xu, Milind Tambe
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14342)
- **Abstract**:
> Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

## 59. A Comparative Evaluation of Teacher-Guided Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Autonomous Cyber Operations
- **Authors**: Konur Tholl, Mariam El Mezouar, Ranwa Al Mallah
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14340](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14340)
- **Abstract**:
> Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However, existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed, highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14318](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14318)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Artificial Intelligence (AI) training workloads spanning several tens of thousands of GPUs present unique power management challenges. These arise due to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the synchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a computation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a communication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because compute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large power swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with the increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from the frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical frequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid infrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we need to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the challenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the stack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the pros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged approach to solving the challenge. The proposed solutions are rigorously tested using a combination of real hardware and Microsoft's in-house cloud power simulator, providing critical insights into the efficacy of these interventions under real-world conditions.
