## 1. Knowledge Graphs are Implicit Reward Models: Path-Derived Signals Enable Compositional Reasoning
- **Authors**: Yuval Kansal , Niraj K. Jha

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.

- **Abstract**:
> Critical domain knowledge typically resides with few experts, creating organizational bottlenecks in scalability and decision-making. Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains.

## 3. The Plausibility Trap: Using Probabilistic Engines for Deterministic Tasks
- **Authors**: Ivan Carrera , Daniel Maldonado-Ruiz
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15130](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15130)
- **Abstract**:
> The ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is driving a paradigm shift where user convenience supersedes computational efficiency. This article defines the "Plausibility Trap": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the "efficiency tax"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15075](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15075)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are widely used in real-world applications such as customer service, web navigation, and software engineering. As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance. However, existing research predominantly focuses on \textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining the reasoning behind agent behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.

- **Authors**: Ben Schaper , Maxime Di Folco , Bernhard Kainz , Julia A. Schnabel , Cosmin I. Bercea
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14827](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14827)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models show strong zero-shot performance for chest X-ray classification, but standard flat metrics fail to distinguish between clinically minor and severe errors. This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs.

## 6. CI4A: Semantic Component Interfaces for Agents Empowering Web Automation
- **Authors**: Zhi Qiu , Jiazheng Sun , Chenxiao Xia , Jun Zheng , Xin Peng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14790](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14790)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in high-level semantic planning, they remain limited in handling fine-grained, low-level web component manipulations. To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.

## 7. DARA: Few-shot Budget Allocation in Online Advertising via In-Context Decision Making with RL-Finetuned LLMs
- **Authors**: Mingxuan Song , Yusen Huo , Bohan Zhou , Shenglin Yin , Zhen Xiao , Jieyi Long , Zhilin Zhang , Chuan Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14711](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14711)
- **Abstract**:
> Optimizing the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions under budget constraints poses a complex challenge in online advertising, under the paradigm of AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB). Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

- **Authors**: Zecong Tang , Zixu Wang , Yifei Wang , Weitong Lian , Tianjian Gao , Haoran Li , Tengju Ru , Lingyi Meng , Zhejun Cui , Yichen Zhu , Qi Kang , Kaixuan Wang , Yu Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14702](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14702)
- **Abstract**:
> Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.

## 9. Gaming the Judge: Unfaithful Chain-of-Thought Can Undermine Agent Evaluation
- **Authors**: Muhammad Khalifa , Lajanugen Logeswaran , Jaekyeom Kim , Sungryull Sohn , Yunxiang Zhang , Moontae Lee , Hao Peng , Lu Wang , Honglak Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14691](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14691)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.

## 10. IB-GRPO: Aligning LLM-based Learning Path Recommendation with Educational Objectives via Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization
- **Authors**: Shuai Wang , Yaoming Yang , Bingdong Li , Hao Hao , Aimin Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14686](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14686)
- **Abstract**:
> Learning Path Recommendation (LPR) aims to generate personalized sequences of learning items that maximize long-term learning effect while respecting pedagogical principles and operational constraints. Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{\epsilon+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi using the KES simulator with a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines.

## 11. Local Language Models for Context-Aware Adaptive Anonymization of Sensitive Text
- **Authors**: Aisvarya Adeseye , Jouni Isoaho , Seppo Virtanen , Mohammad Tahir
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14683](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14683)
- **Abstract**:
> Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.

## 12. Query-Efficient Agentic Graph Extraction Attacks on GraphRAG Systems
- **Authors**: Shuhua Yang , Jiahao Zhang , Yilong Wang , Dongwon Lee , Suhang Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14662](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14662)
- **Abstract**:
> Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) systems construct knowledge graphs over document collections to support multi-hop reasoning. While prior work shows that GraphRAG responses may leak retrieved subgraphs, the feasibility of query-efficient reconstruction of the hidden graph structure remains unexplored under realistic query budgets. We study a budget-constrained black-box setting where an adversary adaptively queries the system to steal its latent entity-relation graph. We propose AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), a framework that leverages a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory modules, and a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. We evaluate AGEA on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems. Under identical query budgets, AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision. These results demonstrate that modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured, agentic extraction attacks, even under strict query limits.

## 13. Large Language Model-Powered Evolutionary Code Optimization on a Phylogenetic Tree
- **Authors**: Leyi Zhao , Weijie Huang , Yitong Guo , Jiang Bian , Chenghong Wang , Xuhong Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14523](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14523)
- **Abstract**:
> Optimizing scientific computing algorithms for modern GPUs is a labor-intensive and iterative process involving repeated code modification, benchmarking, and tuning across complex hardware and software stacks. Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

## 14. On the Generalization Gap in LLM Planning: Tests and Verifier-Reward RL
- **Authors**: Valerio Belcamino , Nicholas Attolino , Alessio Capitanelli , Fulvio Mastrogiovanni
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14456](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14456)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.

## 15. VisTIRA: Closing the Image-Text Modality Gap in Visual Math Reasoning via Structured Tool Integration
- **Authors**: Saeed Khaki , Ashudeep Singh , Nima Safaei , Kamal Ginotra
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14440](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14440)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-language models (VLMs) lag behind text-only language models on mathematical reasoning when the same problems are presented as images rather than text. We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.

## 16. Epistemic Constitutionalism Or: how to avoid coherence bias
- **Authors**: Michele Loi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14295](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14295)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models increasingly function as artificial reasoners: they evaluate arguments, assign credibility, and express confidence. Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.

## 17. Iterative Refinement Improves Compositional Image Generation
- **Authors**: Shantanu Jaiswal , Mihir Prabhudesai , Nikash Bhardwaj , Zheyang Qin , Amir Zadeh , Chuan Li , Katerina Fragkiadaki , Deepak Pathak
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15286](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15286)
- **Abstract**:
> Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation. Results and visualizations are available at this https URL

## 18. MolecularIQ: Characterizing Chemical Reasoning Capabilities Through Symbolic Verification on Molecular Graphs
- **Authors**: Christoph Bartmann , Johannes Schimunek , Mykyta Ielanskyi , Philipp Seidl , Günter Klambauer , Sohvi Luukkonen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15279](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15279)
- **Abstract**:
> A molecule's properties are fundamentally determined by its composition and structure encoded in its molecular graph. Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15267](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15267)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into legal applications, including judicial decision support, legal practice assistance, and public-facing legal services. While LLMs show strong potential in handling legal knowledge and tasks, their deployment in real-world legal settings raises critical concerns beyond surface-level accuracy, involving the soundness of legal reasoning processes and trustworthy issues such as fairness and reliability. Systematic evaluation of LLM performance in legal tasks has therefore become essential for their responsible adoption. This survey identifies key challenges in evaluating LLMs for legal tasks grounded in real-world legal practice. We analyze the major difficulties involved in assessing LLM performance in the legal domain, including outcome correctness, reasoning reliability, and trustworthiness. Building on these challenges, we review and categorize existing evaluation methods and benchmarks according to their task design, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We further discuss the extent to which current approaches address these challenges, highlight their limitations, and outline future research directions toward more realistic, reliable, and legally grounded evaluation frameworks for LLMs in legal domains.

- **Authors**: Paige S. DeVries , Michaela Okosi , Ming Li , Nora Dunphy. Gidey Gezae , Dante Conway , Abraham Glasser , Raja Kushalnagar , Christian Vogler
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15209)
- **Abstract**:
> We investigate intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people who can use their voice in everyday communication. The inability of IPAs to understand diverse accents including deaf speech renders them largely inaccessible to non-signing and speaking DHH individuals. Using an Echo Show, we compare the usability of natural language input via spoken English; with Alexa's automatic speech recognition and a Wizard-of-Oz setting with a trained facilitator re-speaking commands against that of a large language model (LLM)-assisted touch interface in a mixed-methods study. The touch method was navigated through an LLM-powered "task prompter," which integrated the user's history and smart environment to suggest contextually-appropriate commands. Quantitative results showed no significant differences across both spoken English conditions vs LLM-assisted touch. Qualitative results showed variability in opinions on the usability of each method. Ultimately, it will be necessary to have robust deaf-accented speech recognized natively by IPAs.

## 21. Benchmarking Large Language Models for ABAP Code Generation: An Empirical Study on Iterative Improvement by Compiler Feedback
- **Authors**: Stephan Wallraven , Tim Köhne , Hartmut Westenberger , Andreas Moser
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15188](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15188)
- **Abstract**:
> This work investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating ABAP code. Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.

## 22. The Flexibility Trap: Why Arbitrary Order Limits Reasoning Potential in Diffusion Language Models
- **Authors**: Zanlin Ni , Shenzhi Wang , Yang Yue , Tianyu Yu , Weilin Zhao , Yeguo Hua , Tianyi Chen , Jun Song , Cheng Yu , Bo Zheng , Gao Huang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15165](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15165)
- **Abstract**:
> Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) break the rigid left-to-right constraint of traditional LLMs, enabling token generation in arbitrary orders. Intuitively, this flexibility implies a solution space that strictly supersets the fixed autoregressive trajectory, theoretically unlocking superior reasoning potential for general tasks like mathematics and coding. Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation challenges the premise of existing RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility. We demonstrate that effective reasoning is better elicited by intentionally forgoing arbitrary order and applying standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead. Our approach, JustGRPO, is minimalist yet surprisingly effective (e.g., 89.1% accuracy on GSM8K) while fully retaining the parallel decoding ability of dLLMs. Project page: this https URL

- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for clinical decision support, where hallucinations and unsafe suggestions may pose direct risks to patient safety. These risks are particularly challenging as they often manifest as subtle clinical errors that evade detection by generic metrics, while expert-authored fine-grained rubrics remain costly to construct and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed to automate the generation of instance-specific evaluation rubrics. Our approach grounds evaluation in authoritative medical evidence by decomposing retrieved content into atomic facts and synthesizing them with user interaction constraints to form verifiable, fine-grained evaluation criteria. Evaluated on HealthBench, our framework achieves a Clinical Intent Alignment (CIA) score of 60.12%, a statistically significant improvement over the GPT-4o baseline (55.16%). In discriminative tests, our rubrics yield a mean score delta ($\mu_{\Delta} = 8.658$) and an AUROC of 0.977, nearly doubling the quality separation achieved by GPT-4o baseline (4.972). Beyond evaluation, our rubrics effectively guide response refinement, improving quality by 9.2% (from 59.0% to 68.2%). This provides a scalable and transparent foundation for both evaluating and improving medical LLMs. The code is available at this https URL .

## 24. Outcome-Based RL Provably Leads Transformers to Reason, but Only With the Right Data
- **Authors**: Yuval Ran-Milo , Yotam Alexander , Shahar Mendel , Nadav Cohen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15158](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15158)
- **Abstract**:
> Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.

## 25. Auditing Language Model Unlearning via Information Decomposition
- **Authors**: Anmol Goel , Alan Ritter , Iryna Gurevych
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15111](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15111)
- **Abstract**:
> We expose a critical limitation in current approaches to machine unlearning in language models: despite the apparent success of unlearning algorithms, information about the forgotten data remains linearly decodable from internal representations. To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose a representation-based risk score that can guide abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time, providing a practical mechanism to mitigate privacy leakage. Our work introduces a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning, offering theoretical insight and actionable tools for safer deployment of language models.

## 26. Multi-Agent Constraint Factorization Reveals Latent Invariant Solution Structure
- **Authors**: Christopher Scofield
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15077](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15077)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of large language models often exhibit improved problem-solving performance despite operating on identical information. In this work, we provide a formal explanation for this phenomenon grounded in operator theory and constrained optimization. We model each agent as enforcing a distinct family of validity constraints on a shared solution state, and show that a MAS implements a factorized composition of constraint-enforcement operators. Under mild conditions, these dynamics converge to invariant solution sets defined by the intersection of agent constraint sets. Such invariant structures are generally not dynamically accessible to a single agent applying all constraints simultaneously, even when expressive capacity and information are identical. We extend this result from exact constraint enforcement to soft constraints via proximal operators, and apply the formalism to contemporary text-based dialog systems.

## 27. Knowledge Restoration-driven Prompt Optimization: Unlocking LLM Potential for Open-Domain Relational Triplet Extraction
- **Authors**: Xiaonan Jing , Gongqing Wu , Xingrui Zhuo , Lang Sun , Jiapu Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15037](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15037)
- **Abstract**:
> Open-domain Relational Triplet Extraction (ORTE) is the foundation for mining structured knowledge without predefined schemas. Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate relation redundancy, we design a relation canonicalization memory that collects representative relations and provides semantically distinct schemas for the triplets. Extensive experiments across three datasets show that KRPO significantly outperforms strong baselines in the extraction F1 score.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15034)
- **Abstract**:
> Driver distraction remains a leading contributor to motor vehicle crashes, necessitating rigorous evaluation of new in-vehicle technologies. This study assessed the visual and cognitive demands associated with an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agent (Gemini Live) during on-road driving, comparing it against handsfree phone calls, visual turn-by-turn guidance (low load baseline), and the Operation Span (OSPAN) task (high load anchor). Thirty-two licensed drivers completed five secondary tasks while visual and cognitive demands were measured using the Detection Response Task (DRT) for cognitive load, eye-tracking for visual attention, and subjective workload ratings. Results indicated that Gemini Live interactions (both single-turn and multi-turn) and hands-free phone calls shared similar levels of cognitive load, between that of visual turn-by-turn guidance and OSPAN. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive load remained stable across extended multi-turn conversations. All tasks maintained mean glance durations well below the well-established 2-second safety threshold, confirming low visual demand. Furthermore, drivers consistently dedicated longer glances to the roadway between brief off-road glances toward the device during task completion, particularly during voice-based interactions, rendering longer total-eyes-off-road time findings less consequential. Subjective ratings mirrored objective data, with participants reporting low effort, demands, and perceived distraction for Gemini Live. These findings demonstrate that advanced LLM conversational agents, when implemented via voice interfaces, impose cognitive and visual demands comparable to established, low-risk hands-free benchmarks, supporting their safe deployment in the driving environment.

## 29. Obscuring Data Contamination Through Translation: Evidence from Arabic Corpora
- **Authors**: Chaymaa Abbas , Nour Shamaa , Mariette Awad
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14994](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14994)
- **Abstract**:
> Data contamination undermines the validity of Large Language Model evaluation by enabling models to rely on memorized benchmark content rather than true generalization. While prior work has proposed contamination detection methods, these approaches are largely limited to English benchmarks, leaving multilingual contamination poorly understood. In this work, we investigate contamination dynamics in multilingual settings by fine-tuning several open-weight LLMs on varying proportions of Arabic datasets and evaluating them on original English benchmarks. To detect memorization, we extend the Tested Slot Guessing method with a choice-reordering strategy and incorporate Min-K% probability analysis, capturing both behavioral and distributional contamination signals. Our results show that translation into Arabic suppresses conventional contamination indicators, yet models still benefit from exposure to contaminated data, particularly those with stronger Arabic capabilities. This effect is consistently reflected in rising Mink% scores and increased cross-lingual answer consistency as contamination levels grow. To address this blind spot, we propose Translation-Aware Contamination Detection, which identifies contamination by comparing signals across multiple translated benchmark variants rather than English alone. The Translation-Aware Contamination Detection reliably exposes contamination even when English-only methods fail. Together, our findings highlight the need for multilingual, translation-aware evaluation pipelines to ensure fair, transparent, and reproducible assessment of LLMs.

## 30. InstructTime++: Time Series Classification with Multimodal Language Modeling via Implicit Feature Enhancement
- **Authors**: Mingyue Cheng , Xiaoyu Tao , Huajian Zhang , Qi Liu , Enhong Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14968](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14968)
- **Abstract**:
> Most existing time series classification methods adopt a discriminative paradigm that maps input sequences directly to one-hot encoded class labels. While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++.

## 31. A Comprehensive Benchmark of Language Models on Unicode and Romanized Sinhala
- **Authors**: Minuri Rajapakse , Ruvan Weerasinghe
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14958](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14958)
- **Abstract**:
> The performance of Language Models (LMs) on lower-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sinhala remains under-explored, particularly for Romanized Sinhala, which is prevalent in digital communication. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of modern LMs on a diverse corpus of Unicode and Romanized Sinhala. We evaluate open-source models using perplexity, a measure of how well a model predicts a text, and leading closed-source models via a qualitative analysis of sentence completion. Our findings reveal that the Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 model achieves the strongest predictive performance on Unicode text and the Mistral-7B-v0.3 model for Romanized text. The results also highlight the strong all-around performance of the Llama-3.1-8B model for both scripts. Furthermore, a significant performance disparity exists among closed-source models: Gemini-1.5-pro and DeepSeek excel at Unicode generation, whereas Claude-3.5-Sonnet is superior at handling Romanized text. These results provide an essential guide for practitioners selecting models for Sinhala-specific applications and highlight the critical role of training data in handling script variations.

## 32. CorpusQA: A 10 Million Token Benchmark for Corpus-Level Analysis and Reasoning
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Lu , Chenliang Li , Yingcheng Shi , Weizhou Shen , Ming Yan , Fei Huang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14952)
- **Abstract**:
> While large language models now handle million-token contexts, their capacity for reasoning across entire document repositories remains largely untested. Existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they are mostly limited to single long texts or rely on a "sparse retrieval" assumption-that answers can be derived from a few relevant chunks. This assumption fails for true corpus-level analysis, where evidence is highly dispersed across hundreds of documents and answers require global integration, comparison, and statistical aggregation. To address this critical gap, we introduce CorpusQA, a new benchmark scaling up to 10 million tokens, generated via a novel data synthesis framework. By decoupling reasoning from textual representation, this framework creates complex, computation-intensive queries with programmatically guaranteed ground-truth answers, challenging systems to perform holistic reasoning over vast, unstructured text without relying on fallible human annotation. We further demonstrate the utility of our framework beyond evaluation, showing that fine-tuning on our synthesized data effectively enhances an LLM's general long-context reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art long-context LLMs struggle as input length increases, and standard retrieval-augmented generation systems collapse entirely. Our findings indicate that memory-augmented agentic architectures offer a more robust alternative, suggesting a critical shift is needed from simply extending context windows to developing advanced architectures for global information synthesis.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14921](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14921)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable multimodal reasoning for robotic perception and interaction, but their deployment in real-world systems remains constrained by latency, limited onboard resources, and privacy risks of cloud offloading. Edge intelligence within 6G, particularly Open RAN and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), offers a pathway to address these challenges by bringing computation closer to the data source. This work investigates the deployment of VLMs on ORAN/MEC infrastructure using the Unitree G1 humanoid robot as an embodied testbed. We design a WebRTC-based pipeline that streams multimodal data to an edge node and evaluate LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct deployed at the edge versus in the cloud under real-time conditions. Our results show that edge deployment preserves near-cloud accuracy while reducing end-to-end latency by 5\%. We further evaluate Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, a compact model optimized for resource-constrained environments, which achieves sub-second responsiveness, cutting latency by more than half but at the cost of accuracy.

## 34. What Makes Low-Bit Quantization-Aware Training Work for Reasoning LLMs? A Systematic Study
- **Authors**: Keyu Lv , Manyi Zhang , Xiaobo Xia , Jingchen Ni , Shannan Yan , Xianzhi Yu , Lu Hou , Chun Yuan , Haoli Bai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14888](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14888)
- **Abstract**:
> Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.

## 35. RECAP: Resistance Capture in Text-based Mental Health Counseling with Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Anqi Li , Yuqian Chen , Yu Lu , Zhaoming Chen , Yuan Xie , Zhenzhong Lan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14780)
- **Abstract**:
> Recognizing and navigating client resistance is critical for effective mental health counseling, yet detecting such behaviors is particularly challenging in text-based interactions. Existing NLP approaches oversimplify resistance categories, ignore the sequential dynamics of therapeutic interventions, and offer limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose PsyFIRE, a theoretically grounded framework capturing 13 fine-grained resistance behaviors alongside collaborative interactions. Based on PsyFIRE, we construct the ClientResistance corpus with 23,930 annotated utterances from real-world Chinese text-based counseling, each supported by context-specific rationales. Leveraging this dataset, we develop RECAP, a two-stage framework that detects resistance and fine-grained resistance types with explanations. RECAP achieves 91.25% F1 for distinguishing collaboration and resistance and 66.58% macro-F1 for fine-grained resistance categories classification, outperforming leading prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points. Applied to a separate counseling dataset and a pilot study with 62 counselors, RECAP reveals the prevalence of resistance, its negative impact on therapeutic relationships and demonstrates its potential to improve counselors' understanding and intervention strategies.

## 36. Mechanism Shift During Post-training from Autoregressive to Masked Diffusion Language Models
- **Authors**: Injin Kong , Hyoungjoon Lee , Yohan Jo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14758](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14758)
- **Abstract**:
> Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.

## 37. AQAScore: Evaluating Semantic Alignment in Text-to-Audio Generation via Audio Question Answering
- **Authors**: Chun-Yi Kuan , Kai-Wei Chang , Hung-yi Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14728](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14728)
- **Abstract**:
> Although text-to-audio generation has made remarkable progress in realism and diversity, the development of evaluation metrics has not kept pace. Widely-adopted approaches, typically based on embedding similarity like CLAPScore, effectively measure general relevance but remain limited in fine-grained semantic alignment and compositional reasoning. To address this, we introduce AQAScore, a backbone-agnostic evaluation framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of audio-aware large language models (ALLMs). AQAScore reformulates assessment as a probabilistic semantic verification task; rather than relying on open-ended text generation, it estimates alignment by computing the exact log-probability of a "Yes" answer to targeted semantic queries. We evaluate AQAScore across multiple benchmarks, including human-rated relevance, pairwise comparison, and compositional reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that AQAScore consistently achieves higher correlation with human judgments than similarity-based metrics and generative prompting baselines, showing its effectiveness in capturing subtle semantic inconsistencies and scaling with the capability of underlying ALLMs.

## 38. HERMES: KV Cache as Hierarchical Memory for Efficient Streaming Video Understanding
- **Authors**: Haowei Zhang , Shudong Yang , Jinlan Fu , See-Kiong Ng , Xipeng Qiu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

The model is built upon Qwen2.5-32B and refined via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL). A central innovation is our proposed offline RL method, which provides superior training stability and efficiency over standard online RL methods such as GRPO. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models post-trained on Qwen2.5-32B, attaining average accuracies of 90.9% on AIME 2024 and 85.6% on AIME 2025. Our work demonstrates offline RL as a stable and efficient paradigm for advancing reasoning in LLMs. All experiments were conducted on Huawei Ascend 910C NPUs.

## 40. HCVR Scene Generation: High Compatibility Virtual Reality Environment Generation for Extended Redirected Walking
- **Authors**: Yiran Zhang , Xingpeng Sun , Aniket Bera
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14679](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14679)
- **Abstract**:
> Natural walking enhances immersion in virtual environments (VEs), but physical space limitations and obstacles hinder exploration, especially in large virtual scenes. Redirected Walking (RDW) techniques mitigate this by subtly manipulating the virtual camera to guide users away from physical collisions within pre-defined VEs. However, RDW efficacy diminishes significantly when substantial geometric divergence exists between the physical and virtual environments, leading to unavoidable collisions. Existing scene generation methods primarily focus on object relationships or layout aesthetics, often neglecting the crucial aspect of physical compatibility required for effective RDW. To address this, we introduce HCVR (High Compatibility Virtual Reality Environment Generation), a novel framework that generates virtual scenes inherently optimized for alignment-based RDW controllers. HCVR first employs ENI++, a novel, boundary-sensitive metric to evaluate the incompatibility between physical and virtual spaces by comparing rotation-sensitive visibility polygons. Guided by the ENI++ compatibility map and user prompts, HCVR utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware 3D asset retrieval and initial layout generation. The framework then strategically adjusts object selection, scaling, and placement to maximize coverage of virtually incompatible regions, effectively guiding users towards RDW-feasible paths. User studies evaluating physical collisions and layout quality demonstrate HCVR's effectiveness with HCVR-generated scenes, resulting in 22.78 times fewer physical collisions and received 35.89\% less on ENI++ score compared to LLM-based generation with RDW, while also receiving 12.5\% higher scores on user feedback to layout design.

## 41. INFA-Guard: Mitigating Malicious Propagation via Infection-Aware Safeguarding in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems
- **Authors**: Yijin Zhou , Xiaoya Lu , Dongrui Liu , Junchi Yan , Jing Shao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14667](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14667)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, where malicious influence can propagate virally through inter-agent communication. Conventional safeguards often rely on a binary paradigm that strictly distinguishes between benign and attack agents, failing to account for infected agents i.e., benign entities converted by attack agents. In this paper, we propose Infection-Aware Guard, INFA-Guard, a novel defense framework that explicitly identifies and addresses infected agents as a distinct threat category. By leveraging infection-aware detection and topological constraints, INFA-Guard accurately localizes attack sources and infected ranges. During remediation, INFA-Guard replaces attackers and rehabilitates infected ones, avoiding malicious propagation while preserving topological integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that INFA-Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average of 33%, while exhibiting cross-model robustness, superior topological generalization, and high cost-effectiveness.

## 42. NeuroFilter: Privacy Guardrails for Conversational LLM Agents
- **Authors**: Saswat Das , Ferdinando Fioretto
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14660](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14660)
- **Abstract**:
> This work addresses the computational challenge of enforcing privacy for agentic Large Language Models (LLMs), where privacy is governed by the contextual integrity framework. Indeed, existing defenses rely on LLM-mediated checking stages that add substantial latency and cost, and that can be undermined in multi-turn interactions through manipulation or benign-looking conversational scaffolding. Contrasting this background, this paper makes a key observation: internal representations associated with privacy-violating intent can be separated from benign requests using linear structure. Using this insight, the paper proposes NeuroFilter, a guardrail framework that operationalizes contextual integrity by mapping norm violations to simple directions in the model's activation space, enabling detection even when semantic filters are bypassed. The proposed filter is also extended to capture threats arising during long conversations using the concept of activation velocity, which measures cumulative drift in internal representations across turns. A comprehensive evaluation across over 150,000 interactions and covering models from 7B to 70B parameters, illustrates the strong performance of NeuroFilter in detecting privacy attacks while maintaining zero false positives on benign prompts, all while reducing the computational inference cost by several orders of magnitude when compared to LLM-based agentic privacy defenses.

## 43. Say Anything but This: When Tokenizer Betrays Reasoning in LLMs
- **Authors**: Navid Ayoobi , Marcus I Armstrong , Arjun Mukherjee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14658](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14658)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) reason over discrete token ID sequences, yet modern subword tokenizers routinely produce non-unique encodings: multiple token ID sequences can detokenize to identical surface strings. This representational mismatch creates an unmeasured fragility wherein reasoning processes can fail. LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct "words" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation. These findings indicate that part of apparent reasoning deficiency originates in the tokenizer layer, motivating tokenizer-level remedies before incurring the cost of training ever-larger models on ever-larger corpora.

- **Authors**: James Brock , Ce Zhang , Nantheera Anantrasirichai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14637](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14637)
- **Abstract**:
> The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, together with advances in deep learning, creates new opportunities for enhancing forest monitoring workflows. Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.

## 45. Scaling Ambiguity: Augmenting Human Annotation in Speech Emotion Recognition with Audio-Language Models
- **Authors**: Wenda Zhang , Hongyu Jin , Siyi Wang , Zhiqiang Wei , Ting Dang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14620](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14620)
- **Abstract**:
> Speech Emotion Recognition models typically use single categorical labels, overlooking the inherent ambiguity of human emotions. Ambiguous Emotion Recognition addresses this by representing emotions as probability distributions, but progress is limited by unreliable ground-truth distributions inferred from sparse human annotations. This paper explores whether Large Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can mitigate the annotation bottleneck by generating high-quality synthetic annotations. We introduce a framework leveraging ALMs to create Synthetic Perceptual Proxies, augmenting human annotations to improve ground-truth distribution reliability. We validate these proxies through statistical analysis of their alignment with human distributions and evaluate their impact by fine-tuning ALMs with the augmented emotion distributions. Furthermore, to address class imbalance and enable unbiased evaluation, we propose DiME-Aug, a Distribution-aware Multimodal Emotion Augmentation strategy. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that synthetic annotations enhance emotion distribution, especially in low-ambiguity regions where annotation agreement is high. However, benefits diminish for highly ambiguous emotions with greater human disagreement. This work provides the first evidence that ALMs could address annotation scarcity in ambiguous emotion recognition, but highlights the need for more advanced prompting or generation strategies to handle highly ambiguous cases.

## 46. HELIOS: Hierarchical Graph Abstraction for Structure-Aware LLM Decompilation
- **Authors**: Yonatan Gizachew Achamyeleh , Harsh Thomare , Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14598)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to binary decompilation, yet they still treat code as plain text and ignore the graphs that govern program control flow. This limitation often yields syntactically fragile and logically inconsistent output, especially for optimized binaries. This paper presents \textsc{HELIOS}, a framework that reframes LLM-based decompilation as a structured reasoning task. \textsc{HELIOS} summarizes a binary's control flow and function calls into a hierarchical text representation that spells out basic blocks, their successors, and high-level patterns such as loops and conditionals. This representation is supplied to a general-purpose LLM, along with raw decompiler output, optionally combined with a compiler-in-the-loop that returns error messages when the generated code fails to build. On HumanEval-Decompile for \texttt{x86\_64}, \textsc{HELIOS} raises average object file compilability from 45.0\% to 85.2\% for Gemini~2.0 and from 71.4\% to 89.6\% for GPT-4.1~Mini. With compiler feedback, compilability exceeds 94\% and functional correctness improves by up to 5.6 percentage points over text-only prompting. Across six architectures drawn from x86, ARM, and MIPS, \textsc{HELIOS} reduces the spread in functional correctness while keeping syntactic correctness consistently high, all without fine-tuning. These properties make \textsc{HELIOS} a practical building block for reverse engineering workflows in security settings where analysts need recompilable, semantically faithful code across diverse hardware targets.

## 47. IntelliSA: An Intelligent Static Analyzer for IaC Security Smell Detection Using Symbolic Rules and Neural Inference
- **Authors**: Qiyue Mei , Michael Fu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14595](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14595)
- **Abstract**:
> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables automated provisioning of large-scale cloud and on-premise environments, reducing the need for repetitive manual setup. However, this automation is a double-edged sword: a single misconfiguration in IaC scripts can propagate widely, leading to severe system downtime and security risks. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain security smells--bad coding patterns that may introduce vulnerabilities--and have proposed static analyzers based on symbolic rules to detect them. Yet, our preliminary analysis reveals that rule-based detection alone tends to over-approximate, producing excessive false positives and increasing the burden of manual inspection. In this paper, we present IntelliSA, an intelligent static analyzer for IaC security smell detection that integrates symbolic rules with neural inference. IntelliSA applies symbolic rules to over-approximate potential smells for broad coverage, then employs neural inference to filter false positives. While an LLM can effectively perform this filtering, reliance on LLM APIs introduces high cost and latency, raises data governance concerns, and limits reproducibility and offline deployment. To address the challenges, we adopt a knowledge distillation approach: an LLM teacher generates pseudo-labels to train a compact student model--over 500x smaller--that learns from the teacher's knowledge and efficiently classifies false positives. We evaluate IntelliSA against two static analyzers and three LLM baselines (Claude-4, Grok-4, and GPT-5) using a human-labeled dataset including 241 security smells across 11,814 lines of real-world IaC code. Experimental results show that IntelliSA achieves the highest F1 score (83%), outperforming baselines by 7-42%. Moreover, IntelliSA demonstrates the best cost-effectiveness, detecting 60% of security smells while inspecting less than 2% of the codebase.

## 48. Self-Blinding and Counterfactual Self-Simulation Mitigate Biases and Sycophancy in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Brian Christian , Matan Mazor
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14553](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14553)
- **Abstract**:
> Fair decisions require ignoring irrelevant, potentially biasing, information. To achieve this, decision-makers need to approximate what decision they would have made had they not known certain facts, such as the gender or race of a job candidate. This counterfactual self-simulation is notoriously hard for humans, leading to biased judgments even by well-meaning actors. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) suffer from similar limitations in their ability to approximate what decisions they would make under counterfactual knowledge in offsetting gender and race biases and overcoming sycophancy. We show that prompting models to ignore or pretend not to know biasing information fails to offset these biases and occasionally backfires. However, unlike humans, LLMs can be given access to a ground-truth model of their own counterfactual cognition -- their own API. We show that this access to the responses of a blinded replica enables fairer decisions, while providing greater transparency to distinguish implicit from intentionally biased behavior.

## 50. Towards Execution-Grounded Automated AI Research
- **Authors**: Chenglei Si , Zitong Yang , Yejin Choi , Emmanuel Candès , Diyi Yang , Tatsunori Hashimoto
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14525](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14525)
- **Abstract**:
> Automated AI research holds great potential to accelerate scientific discovery. However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas. We thoroughly analyze the executed ideas and training dynamics to facilitate future efforts towards execution-grounded automated AI research.

## 51. GutenOCR: A Grounded Vision-Language Front-End for Documents
- **Authors**: Hunter Heidenreich , Ben Elliott , Olivia Dinica , Yosheb Getachew
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14490](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14490)
- **Abstract**:
> GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

## 52. Tokenomics: Quantifying Where Tokens Are Used in Agentic Software Engineering
- **Authors**: Mohamad Salim , Jasmine Latendresse , SayedHassan Khatoonabadi , Emad Shihab
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14470](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14470)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM-based Multi-Agent (LLM-MA) systems are increasingly applied to automate complex software engineering tasks such as requirements engineering, code generation, and testing. However, their operational efficiency and resource consumption remain poorly understood, hindering practical adoption due to unpredictable costs and environmental impact. To address this, we conduct an analysis of token consumption patterns in an LLM-MA system within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), aiming to understand where tokens are consumed across distinct software engineering activities. We analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks performed by the ChatDev framework using a GPT-5 reasoning model, mapping its internal phases to distinct development stages (Design, Coding, Code Completion, Code Review, Testing, and Documentation) to create a standardized evaluation framework. We then quantify and compare token distribution (input, output, reasoning) across these stages. Our preliminary findings show that the iterative Code Review stage accounts for the majority of token consumption for an average of 59.4% of tokens. Furthermore, we observe that input tokens consistently constitute the largest share of consumption for an average of 53.9%, providing empirical evidence for potentially significant inefficiencies in agentic collaboration. Our results suggest that the primary cost of agentic software engineering lies not in initial code generation but in automated refinement and verification. Our novel methodology can help practitioners predict expenses and optimize workflows, and it directs future research toward developing more token-efficient agent collaboration protocols.

## 53. Diffusion Large Language Models for Black-Box Optimization
- **Authors**: Ye Yuan , Can (Sam) Chen , Zipeng Sun , Dinghuai Zhang , Christopher Pal , Xue Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14446](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14446)
- **Abstract**:
> Offline black-box optimization (BBO) aims to find optimal designs based solely on an offline dataset of designs and their labels. Such scenarios frequently arise in domains like DNA sequence design and robotics, where only a few labeled data points are available. Traditional methods typically rely on task-specific proxy or generative models, overlooking the in-context learning capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts have adapted autoregressive LLMs to BBO by framing task descriptions and offline datasets as natural language prompts, enabling direct design generation. However, these designs often contain bidirectional dependencies, which left-to-right models struggle to capture. In this paper, we explore diffusion LLMs for BBO, leveraging their bidirectional modeling and iterative refinement capabilities. This motivates our in-context denoising module: we condition the diffusion LLM on the task description and the offline dataset, both formatted in natural language, and prompt it to denoise masked designs into improved candidates. To guide the generation toward high-performing designs, we introduce masked diffusion tree search, which casts the denoising process as a step-wise Monte Carlo Tree Search that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation. Each node represents a partially masked design, each denoising step is an action, and candidates are evaluated via expected improvement under a Gaussian Process trained on the offline dataset. Our method, dLLM, achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot settings on design-bench.

## 54. Agentic AI Meets Edge Computing in Autonomous UAV Swarms
- **Authors**: Thuan Minh Nguyen , Vu Tuan Truong , Long Bao Le
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14437](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14437)
- **Abstract**:
> The integration of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs) with autonomous reasoning, planning, and execution, into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms opens new operational possibilities and brings the vision of the Internet of Drones closer to reality. However, infrastructure constraints, dynamic environments, and the computational demands of multi-agent coordination limit real-world deployment in high-risk scenarios such as wildfires and disaster response. This paper investigates the integration of LLM-based agentic AI and edge computing to realize scalable and resilient autonomy in UAV swarms. We first discuss three architectures for supporting UAV swarms - standalone, edge-enabled, and edge-cloud hybrid deployment - each optimized for varying autonomy and connectivity levels. Then, a use case for wildfire search and rescue (SAR) is designed to demonstrate the efficiency of the edge-enabled architecture, enabling high SAR coverage, reduced mission completion times, and a higher level of autonomy compared to traditional approaches. Finally, we highlight open challenges in integrating LLMs and edge computing for mission-critical UAV-swarm applications.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14429](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14429)
- **Abstract**:
> Open science initiatives have strengthened scientific integrity and accelerated research progress across many fields, but the state of their practice within transportation research remains under-investigated. Key features of open science, defined here as data and code availability, are difficult to extract due to the inherent complexity of the field. Previous work has either been limited to small-scale studies due to the labor-intensive nature of manual analysis or has relied on large-scale bibliometric approaches that sacrifice contextual richness. This paper introduces an automatic and scalable feature-extraction pipeline to measure data and code availability in transportation research. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task and validate their performance against a manually curated dataset and through an inter-rater agreement analysis. We applied this pipeline to examine 10,724 research articles published in the Transportation Research Part series of journals between 2019 and 2024. Our analysis found that only 5% of quantitative papers shared a code repository, 4% of quantitative papers shared a data repository, and about 3% of papers shared both, with trends differing across journals, topics, and geographic regions. We found no significant difference in citation counts or review duration between papers that provided data and code and those that did not, suggesting a misalignment between open science efforts and traditional academic metrics. Consequently, encouraging these practices will likely require structural interventions from journals and funding agencies to supplement the lack of direct author incentives. The pipeline developed in this study can be readily scaled to other journals, representing a critical step toward the automated measurement and monitoring of open science practices in transportation research.

- **Authors**: Haotian Xu , Yue Hu , Zhengqiu Zhu , Chen Gao , Ziyou Wang , Junreng Rao , Wenhao Lu , Weishi Li , Quanjun Yin , Yong Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14339](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14339)
- **Abstract**:
> Cross-view spatial reasoning is essential for embodied AI, underpinning spatial understanding, mental simulation and planning in complex environments. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14327](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14327)
- **Abstract**:
> Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver superior accuracy with a reduced number of active parameters, their pre-training represents a significant computationally bottleneck due to underutilized experts and limited training efficiency. This work introduces a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) algorithm designed for the pre-training stage of MoE LLMs. In contrast to previous expert pruning approaches that operate primarily in the post-training phase, the proposed algorithm enhances training efficiency by selectively pruning underutilized experts and reorganizing experts across computing devices according to token distribution statistics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency. In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are deployed at scale, yet their training data life cycle remains opaque. This survey synthesizes research from the past ten years on three tightly coupled axes: (1) data provenance, (2) transparency, and (3) traceability, and three supporting pillars: (4) bias \& uncertainty, (5) data privacy, and (6) tools and techniques that operationalize them. A central contribution is a proposed taxonomy defining the field's domains and listing corresponding artifacts. Through analysis of 95 publications, this work identifies key methodologies concerning data generation, watermarking, bias measurement, data curation, data privacy, and the inherent trade-off between transparency and opacity.

## 59. CORVUS: Red-Teaming Hallucination Detectors via Internal Signal Camouflage in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Nay Myat Min , Long H. Pham , Hongyu Zhang , Jun Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14310](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14310)
- **Abstract**:
> Single-pass hallucination detectors rely on internal telemetry (e.g., uncertainty, hidden-state geometry, and attention) of large language models, implicitly assuming hallucinations leave separable traces in these signals. We study a white-box, model-side adversary that fine-tunes lightweight LoRA adapters on the model while keeping the detector fixed, and introduce CORVUS, an efficient red-teaming procedure that learns to camouflage detector-visible telemetry under teacher forcing, including an embedding-space FGSM attention stress test. Trained on 1,000 out-of-distribution Alpaca instructions (<0.5% trainable parameters), CORVUS transfers to FAVA-Annotation across Llama-2, Vicuna, Llama-3, and Qwen2.5, and degrades both training-free detectors (e.g., LLM-Check) and probe-based detectors (e.g., SEP, ICR-probe), motivating adversary-aware auditing that incorporates external grounding or cross-model evidence.

## 60. Guardrails for trust, safety, and ethical development and deployment of Large Language Models (LLM)
- **Authors**: Anjanava Biswas , Wrick Talukdar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14298](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14298)
- **Abstract**:
> The AI era has ushered in Large Language Models (LLM) to the technological forefront, which has been much of the talk in 2023, and is likely to remain as such for many years to come. LLMs are the AI models that are the power house behind generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. These AI models, fueled by vast amounts of data and computational prowess, have unlocked remarkable capabilities, from human-like text generation to assisting with natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. They have quickly become the foundation upon which countless applications and software services are being built, or at least being augmented with. However, as with any groundbreaking innovations, the rise of LLMs brings forth critical safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. These models are found to have a propensity to leak private information, produce false information, and can be coerced into generating content that can be used for nefarious purposes by bad actors, or even by regular users unknowingly. Implementing safeguards and guardrailing techniques is imperative for applications to ensure that the content generated by LLMs are safe, secure, and ethical. Thus, frameworks to deploy mechanisms that prevent misuse of these models via application implementations is imperative. In this study, wepropose a Flexible Adaptive Sequencing mechanism with trust and safety modules, that can be used to implement safety guardrails for the development and deployment of LLMs.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14289](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14289)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding research papers remains challenging for foundation models due to specialized scientific discourse and complex figures and tables, yet existing benchmarks offer limited fine-grained evaluation at scale. To address this gap, we introduce RPC-Bench, a large-scale question-answering benchmark built from review-rebuttal exchanges of high-quality computer science papers, containing 15K human-verified QA pairs. We design a fine-grained taxonomy aligned with the scientific research flow to assess models' ability to understand and answer why, what, and how questions in scholarly contexts. We also define an elaborate LLM-human interaction annotation framework to support large-scale labeling and quality control. Following the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, we develop a scalable framework that evaluates models on correctness-completeness and conciseness, with high agreement to human judgment. Experiments reveal that even the strongest models (GPT-5) achieve only 68.2% correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% after conciseness adjustment, highlighting substantial gaps in precise academic paper understanding. Our code and data are available at this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14288](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14288)
- **Abstract**:
> We present \textbf{DeepInflation}, an AI agent designed for research and model discovery in inflationary cosmology. Built upon a multi-agent architecture, \textbf{DeepInflation} integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a symbolic regression (SR) engine and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) knowledge base. This framework enables the agent to automatically explore and verify the vast landscape of inflationary potentials while grounding its outputs in established theoretical literature. We demonstrate that \textbf{DeepInflation} can successfully discover simple and viable single-field slow-roll inflationary potentials consistent with the latest observations (here ACT DR6 results as example) or any given $n_s$ and $r$, and provide accurate theoretical context for obscure inflationary scenarios. \textbf{DeepInflation} serves as a prototype for a new generation of autonomous scientific discovery engines in cosmology, which enables researchers and non-experts alike to explore the inflationary landscape using natural language. This agent is available at this https URL .

## 63. Hallucination-Free Automatic Question & Answer Generation for Intuitive Learning
- **Authors**: Nicholas X. Wang , Aggelos K. Katsaggelos
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14280](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14280)
- **Abstract**:
> Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), defined as fluent yet incorrect or incoherent outputs, pose a significant challenge to the automatic generation of educational multiple-choice questions (MCQs). We identified four key hallucination types in MCQ generation: reasoning inconsistencies, insolvability, factual errors, and mathematical errors. To address this, we propose a hallucination-free multi-agent generation framework that breaks down MCQ generation into discrete, verifiable stages. Our framework utilizes both rule-based and LLM-based detection agents, as well as hallucination scoring metrics to optimize question quality. We redefined MCQ generation as an optimization task minimizing hallucination risk while maximizing validity, answerability, and cost-efficiency. We also introduce an agent-led refinement process that uses counterfactual reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) to iteratively improve hallucination in question generation. We evaluated a sample of AP- aligned STEM questions, where our system reduced hallucination rates by over 90% compared to baseline generation while preserving the educational value and style of questions. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent collaboration can mitigate hallucinations in educational content creation at scale, paving the way for more reliable LLM-powered learning tools.

- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to solve problems requiring multiple reasoning steps, yet the internal mechanisms enabling such capabilities remain elusive. Unlike existing surveys that primarily focus on engineering methods to enhance performance, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying LLM multi-step reasoning. We organize the survey around a conceptual framework comprising seven interconnected research questions, from how LLMs execute implicit multi-hop reasoning within hidden activations to how verbalized explicit reasoning remodels the internal computation. Finally, we highlight five research directions for future mechanistic studies.

## 65. The Slow Drift of Support: Boundary Failures in Multi-Turn Mental Health LLM Dialogues
- **Authors**: Youyou Cheng , Zhuangwei Kang , Kerry Jiang , Chenyu Sun , Qiyang Pan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14269](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14269)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for mental health support. However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy. This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues.

## 66. Developmental trajectories of decision making and affective dynamics in large language models
- **Authors**: Zhihao Wang , Yiyang Liu , Ting Wang , Zhiyuan Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14268](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14268)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in medicine and clinical workflows, yet we know little about their decision and affective profiles. Taking a historically informed outlook on the future, we treated successive OpenAI models as an evolving lineage and compared them with humans in a gambling task with repeated happiness ratings. Computational analyses showed that some aspects became more human-like: newer models took more risks and displayed more human-like patterns of Pavlovian approach and avoidance. At the same time, distinctly non-human signatures emerged: loss aversion dropped below neutral levels, choices became more deterministic than in humans, affective decay increased across versions and exceeded human levels, and baseline mood remained chronically higher than in humans. These "developmental" trajectories reveal an emerging psychology of machines and have direct implications for AI ethics and for thinking about how LLMs might be integrated into clinical decision support and other high-stakes domains.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14265](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14265)
- **Abstract**:
> The integration of AI chatbots into educational settings has opened new pathways for transforming teaching and learning, offering enhanced support to both educators and learners. This study investigates the design and application of an AI chatbot as an educational tool in higher education. Designed to operate in the Greek language, the chatbot addresses linguistic challenges unique to Greek while delivering accurate, context grounded support aligned with the curriculum. The AI chatbot is built on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework by grounding its responses in specific course content. RAG architecture significantly enhances the chatbots reliability by providing accurate, context-aware responses while mitigating common challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and misinformation. The AI chatbot serves a dual purpose: it enables students to access accurate, ondemand academic support and assists educators in the rapid creation of relevant educational materials. This dual functionality promotes learner autonomy and streamlines the instructional design process. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and perceived usability of RAG based chatbots in higher education, exploring their potential to enhance educational practices and outcomes as well as supporting the broader adoption of AI technologies in language specific educational contexts. Findings from this research are expected to contribute to the emerging field of AI driven education by demonstrating how intelligent systems can be effectively aligned with pedagogical goals.

- **Abstract**:
> The adaptation of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to specific domains depends on high-quality fine-tuning datasets, particularly in instructional format (e.g., Question-Answer - Q&A). However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.
