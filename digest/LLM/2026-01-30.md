- **Abstract**:
> Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity.

- **Abstract**:
> Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

## 4. CAR-bench: Evaluating the Consistency and Limit-Awareness of LLM Agents under Real-World Uncertainty
- **Authors**: Johannes Kirmayr , Lukas Stappen , Elisabeth André
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22027](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22027)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

## 5. Mind the Gap: How Elicitation Protocols Shape the Stated-Revealed Preference Gap in Language Models
- **Authors**: Pranav Mahajan , Ihor Kendiukhov , Syed Hussain , Lydia Nottingham
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21975](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21975)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($\rho$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $\rho$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

## 6. Learning Decentralized LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Actor Critic
- **Authors**: Shuo Liu , Tianle Chen , Ryan Amiri , Christopher Amato
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21972)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

## 7. ToolWeaver: Weaving Collaborative Semantics for Scalable Tool Use in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Bowen Fang , Wen Ye , Yunyue Su , Jinghao Zhang , Qiang Liu , Yesheng Liu , Xin Sun , Shu Wu , Jiabing Yang , Baole Wei , Liang Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21947](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21947)
- **Abstract**:
> Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

## 8. Retrieval-Infused Reasoning Sandbox: A Benchmark for Decoupling Retrieval and Reasoning Capabilities
- **Authors**: Shuangshuang Ying , Zheyu Wang , Yunjian Peng , Jin Chen , Yuhao Wu , Hongbin Lin , Dingyu He , Siyi Liu , Gengchen Yu , YinZhu Piao , Yuchen Wu , Xin Gui , Zhongyuan Peng , Xin Li , Xeron Du , Libo Qin , YiXin Cao , Ge Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21937](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21937)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

## 9. AgenticSimLaw: A Juvenile Courtroom Multi-Agent Debate Simulation for Explainable High-Stakes Tabular Decision Making
- **Authors**: Jon Chun , Kathrine Elkins , Yong Suk Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21936)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains. Data, results, and code will be available on this http URL under the MIT license.

## 10. From Meta-Thought to Execution: Cognitively Aligned Post-Training for Generalizable and Reliable LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Shaojie Wang , Liang Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21909](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21909)
- **Abstract**:
> Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

## 11. astra-langchain4j: Experiences Combining LLMs and Agent Programming
- **Authors**: Rem Collier , Katharine Beaumont , Andrei Ciortea
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21879](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21879)
- **Abstract**:
> Given the emergence of Generative AI over the last two years and the increasing focus on Agentic AI as a form of Multi-Agent System it is important to explore both how such technologies can impact the use of traditional Agent Toolkits and how the wealth of experience encapsulated in those toolkits can influence the design of the new agentic platforms. This paper presents an overview of our experience developing a prototype large language model (LLM) integration for the ASTRA programming language. It presents a brief overview of the toolkit, followed by three example implementations, concluding with a discussion of the experiences garnered through the examples.

## 12. KnowBias: Mitigating Social Bias in LLMs via Know-Bias Neuron Enhancement
- **Authors**: Jinhao Pan , Chahat Raj , Anjishnu Mukherjee , Sina Mansouri , Bowen Wei , Shloka Yada , Ziwei Zhu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21864](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21864)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation. Data and code are available at this https URL .

The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed this http URL , comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.

## 14. A Unified XAI-LLM Approach for EndotrachealSuctioning Activity Recognition
- **Authors**: Hoang Khang Phan , Quang Vinh Dang , Noriyo Colley , Christina Garcia , Nhat Tan Le
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21802](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21802)
- **Abstract**:
> Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

## 15. BioAgent Bench: An AI Agent Evaluation Suite for Bioinformatics
- **Authors**: Dionizije Fa , Marko Čuljak , Bruno Pandža , Mateo Čupić
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21800](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21800)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.

## 16. Language-based Trial and Error Falls Behind in the Era of Experience
- **Authors**: Haoyu Wang , Guozheng Ma , Shugang Cui , Yilun Kong , Haotian Luo , Li Shen , Mengya Gao , Yichao Wu , Xiaogang Wang , Dacheng Tao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21754](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21754)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

## 17. Epistemic Context Learning: Building Trust the Right Way in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems
- **Authors**: Ruiwen Zhou , Maojia Song , Xiaobao Wu , Sitao Cheng , Xunjian Yin , Yuxi Xie , Zhuoqun Hao , Wenyue Hua , Liangming Pan , Soujanya Poria , Min-Yen Kan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21742](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21742)
- **Abstract**:
> Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.

## 18. E-mem: Multi-agent based Episodic Context Reconstruction for LLM Agent Memory
- **Authors**: Kaixiang Wang , Yidan Lin , Jiong Lou , Zhaojiacheng Zhou , Bunyod Suvonov , Jie Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21714](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21714)
- **Abstract**:
> The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents towards System~2 reasoning, characterized by deliberative, high-precision problem-solving, requires maintaining rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons. However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.

## 19. FBS: Modeling Native Parallel Reading inside a Transformer
- **Authors**: Tongxi Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21708](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21708)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) excel across many tasks, yet inference is still dominated by strictly token-by-token autoregression. Existing acceleration methods largely patch this pipeline and miss core human-reading ingredients: content-adaptive foresight, chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and train--test consistency for preview/skimming. We propose the \textbf{Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer} (FBS), which injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG). Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablations show the three modules are complementary.

## 20. TCAP: Tri-Component Attention Profiling for Unsupervised Backdoor Detection in MLLM Fine-Tuning
- **Authors**: Mingzu Liu , Hao Fang , Runmin Cong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21692](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21692)
- **Abstract**:
> Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) facilitates the customization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) but introduces critical backdoor risks via poisoned data. Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

## 21. SONIC-O1: A Real-World Benchmark for Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Audio-Video Understanding
- **Authors**: Ahmed Y. Radwan , Christos Emmanouilidis , Hina Tabassum , Deval Pandya , Shaina Raza
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21666](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21666)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding. We release SONIC-O1 for reproducibility and research: Project page: this https URL Dataset: this https URL Github: this https URL Leaderboard: this https URL

## 22. ScholarGym: Benchmarking Deep Research Workflows on Academic Literature Retrieval
- **Authors**: Hao Shen , Hang Yang , Zhouhong Gu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21654)
- **Abstract**:
> Tool-augmented large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research workflows that iteratively plan queries, invoke external tools, and synthesize information to address complex information needs. Evaluating such workflows presents a fundamental challenge: reliance on live APIs introduces non-determinism, as tool invocations may yield different results across runs due to temporal drift, rate limiting, and evolving backend states. This variance undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons. We present ScholarGym, a simulation environment for reproducible evaluation of deep research workflows on academic literature. The environment decouples workflow components into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment, enabling fine-grained analysis of each stage under controlled conditions. Built on a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval, ScholarGym provides 2,536 queries with expert-annotated ground truth. Experiments across diverse backbone models reveal how reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms interact over iterative refinement.

## 23. Semantic Content Determines Algorithmic Performance
- **Authors**: Martiño Ríos-García , Nawaf Alampara , Kevin Maik Jablonka
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21618](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21618)
- **Abstract**:
> Counting should not depend on what is being counted; more generally, any algorithm's behavior should be invariant to the semantic content of its arguments. We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.

## 24. RecNet: Self-Evolving Preference Propagation for Agentic Recommender Systems
- **Authors**: Bingqian Li , Xiaolei Wang , Junyi Li , Weitao Li , Long Zhang , Sheng Chen , Wayne Xin Zhao , Ji-Rong Wen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21609](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21609)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic recommender systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to model complex user behaviors and support personalized decision-making. However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models exhibit complementary reasoning errors: on the same instance, one model may succeed with a particular decomposition while another fails. We propose Collaborative Reasoning (CORE), a training-time collaboration framework that converts peer success into a learning signal via a cross-teaching protocol. Each problem is solved in two stages: a cold round of independent sampling, followed by a contexted rescue round in which models that failed receive hint extracted from a successful peer. CORE optimizes a combined reward that balances (i) correctness, (ii) a lightweight DPP-inspired diversity term to reduce error overlap, and (iii) an explicit rescue bonus for successful recovery. We evaluate CORE across four standard reasoning datasets GSM8K, MATH, AIME, and GPQA. With only 1,000 training examples, a pair of small open source models (3B+4B) reaches Pass@2 of 99.54% on GSM8K and 92.08% on MATH, compared to 82.50% and 74.82% for single-model training. On harder datasets, the 3B+4B pair reaches Pass@2 of 77.34% on GPQA (trained on 348 examples) and 79.65% on AIME (trained on 792 examples), using a training-time budget of at most 1536 context tokens and 3072 generated tokens. Overall, these results show that training-time collaboration can reliably convert model complementarity into large gains without scaling model size.

## 26. Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning for Active Latent Planning
- **Authors**: Zhi Zheng , Wee Sun Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21598)
- **Abstract**:
> Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \underline{A}c\underline{t}ive Latent \underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on this https URL .

## 27. Chain Of Thought Compression: A Theoritical Analysis
- **Authors**: Juncai Li , Ru Li , Yuxiang Zhou , Boxiang Ma , Jeff Z. Pan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21576](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21576)
- **Abstract**:
> Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21570](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21570)
- **Abstract**:
> The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

## 29. Meta Context Engineering via Agentic Skill Evolution
- **Authors**: Haoran Ye , Xuning He , Vincent Arak , Haonan Dong , Guojie Song
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21557](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21557)
- **Abstract**:
> The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

## 30. ShardMemo: Masked MoE Routing for Sharded Agentic LLM Memory
- **Authors**: Yang Zhao , Chengxiao Dai , Yue Xiu , Mengying Kou , Yuliang Zheng , Dusit Niyato
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21545)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic large language model (LLM) systems rely on external memory for long-horizon state and concurrent multi-agent execution, but centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow. We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

## 31. ARGORA: Orchestrated Argumentation for Causally Grounded LLM Reasoning and Decision Making
- **Authors**: Youngjin Jin , Hanna Kim , Kwanwoo Kim , Chanhee Lee , Seungwon Shin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21533](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21533)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing multi-expert LLM systems gather diverse perspectives but combine them through simple aggregation, obscuring which arguments drove the final decision. We introduce ARGORA, a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing which arguments support or attack each other. By casting these graphs as causal models, ARGORA can systematically remove individual arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying which reasoning chains were necessary and whether decisions would change under targeted modifications. We further introduce a correction mechanism that aligns internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree. Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

## 32. LLaMEA-SAGE: Guiding Automated Algorithm Design with Structural Feedback from Explainable AI
- **Authors**: Niki van Stein , Anna V. Kononova , Lars Kotthoff , Thomas Bäck
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21511](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21511)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity. We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

## 33. The Effectiveness of Style Vectors for Steering Large Language Models: A Human Evaluation

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21505](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21505)
- **Abstract**:
> Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($\lambda \approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($\eta_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($\eta_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($\eta_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21503](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21503)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse domains but suffer from high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations. To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.

## 35. The Path of Least Resistance: Guiding LLM Reasining Trajectories with Prefix Consensus
- **Authors**: Ishan Jindal , Sai Prashanth Akuthota , Jayant Taneja , Sachin Dev Sharma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21494](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21494)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models achieve strong reasoning performance, but inference strategies such as Self-Consistency (SC) are computationally expensive, as they fully expand all reasoning traces. We introduce PoLR (Path of Least Resistance), the first inference-time method to leverage prefix consistency for compute-efficient reasoning. PoLR clusters short prefixes of reasoning traces, identifies the dominant cluster, and expands all paths in that cluster, preserving the accuracy benefits of SC while substantially reducing token usage and latency. Our theoretical analysis, framed via mutual information and entropy, explains why early reasoning steps encode strong signals predictive of final correctness. Empirically, PoLR consistently matches or exceeds SC across GSM8K, MATH500, AIME24/25, and GPQA-DIAMOND, reducing token usage by up to 60% and wall-clock latency by up to 50%. Moreover, PoLR is fully complementary to adaptive inference methods (e.g., Adaptive Consistency, Early-Stopping SC) and can serve as a drop-in pre-filter, making SC substantially more efficient and scalable without requiring model fine-tuning.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21473](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21473)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21448)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain. Our code is available at this https URL .

## 38. The Paradox of Robustness: Decoupling Rule-Based Logic from Affective Noise in High-Stakes Decision-Making
- **Authors**: Jon Chun , Katherine Elkins
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21439)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on this http URL .

## 39. When Prohibitions Become Permissions: Auditing Negation Sensitivity in Language Models
- **Authors**: Katherine Elkins , Jon Chun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21433](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21433)
- **Abstract**:
> When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21414](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21414)
- **Abstract**:
> Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\lambda(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

## 41. TeachBench: A Syllabus-Grounded Framework for Evaluating Teaching Ability in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Zheng Li , Siyao Song , Jingyuan Ma , Rui Li , Ying Zeng , Minghao Li , Zhifang Sui
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21375](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21375)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

## 42. NEMO: Execution-Aware Optimization Modeling via Autonomous Coding Agents
- **Authors**: Yang Song , Anoushka Vyas , Zirui Wei , Sina Khoshfetrat Pakazad , Henrik Ohlsson , Graham Neubig
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21372](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21372)
- **Abstract**:
> In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code. NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair. Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

## 43. Latent Chain-of-Thought as Planning: Decoupling Reasoning from Verbalization
- **Authors**: Jiecong Wang , Hao Peng , Chunyang Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21358)
- **Abstract**:
> Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

- **Abstract**:
> This paper presents a framework for integrating LLM into collaborative learning platforms to enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and inclusivity. The framework employs advanced LLMs as dynamic moderators to facilitate real-time discussions and adapt to learners' evolving needs, ensuring diverse and inclusive educational experiences. Key innovations include robust feedback mechanisms that refine AI moderation, promote reflective learning, and balance participation among users. The system's modular architecture featuring ReactJS for the frontend, Flask for backend operations, and efficient question retrieval supports personalized and engaging interactions through dynamic adjustments to prompts and discussion flows. Testing demonstrates that the framework significantly improves student collaboration, fosters deeper comprehension, and scales effectively across various subjects and user groups. By addressing limitations in static moderation and personalization in existing systems, this work establishes a strong foundation for next-generation AI-driven educational tools, advancing equitable and impactful learning outcomes.

- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

## 46. EHR-RAG: Bridging Long-Horizon Structured Electronic Health Records and Large Language Models via Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- **Authors**: Lang Cao , Qingyu Chen , Yue Guo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21340](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21340)
- **Abstract**:
> Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

- **Authors**: Jennifer Haase , Jana Gonnermann-Müller , Paul H. P. Hanel , Nicolas Leins , Thomas Kosch , Jan Mendling , Sebastian Pokutta
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21339](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21339)
- **Abstract**:
> How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

## 48. TIDE: Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution for LLM-Based Automated Heuristic Design
- **Authors**: Chentong Chen , Mengyuan Zhong , Ye Fan , Jialong Shi , Jianyong Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21239](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21239)
- **Abstract**:
> Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21233](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21233)
- **Abstract**:
> Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound--based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

## 50. Intelli-Planner: Towards Customized Urban Planning via Large Language Model Empowered Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Xixian Yong , Peilin Sun , Zihe Wang , Xiao Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21212](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21212)
- **Abstract**:
> Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

## 51. Uncovering Hidden Correctness in LLM Causal Reasoning via Symbolic Verification
- **Authors**: Paul He , Yinya Huang , Mrinmaya Sachan , Zhijing Jin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21210](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21210)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

## 52. Do Reasoning Models Enhance Embedding Models?
- **Authors**: Wun Yu Chan , Shaojin Chen , Huihao Jing , Kwun Hang Lau , Elton Chun-Chai Li , Zihao Wang , Haoran Li , Yangqiu Song
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21192](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21192)
- **Abstract**:
> State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

## 53. MAD: Modality-Adaptive Decoding for Mitigating Cross-Modal Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Sangyun Chung , Se Yeon Kim , Youngchae Chee , Yong Man Ro
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21181)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

## 54. FrontierScience: Evaluating AI's Ability to Perform Expert-Level Scientific Tasks
- **Authors**: Miles Wang , Robi Lin , Kat Hu , Joy Jiao , Neil Chowdhury , Ethan Chang , Tejal Patwardhan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21165](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21165)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research. FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

## 55. Concise Geometric Description as a Bridge: Unleashing the Potential of LLM for Plane Geometry Problem Solving
- **Authors**: Jingyun Wang , Dian Li , Xiaohan Wang , Gang Liu , Jiahong Yan , Guoliang Kang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21164](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21164)
- **Abstract**:
> Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

## 56. Bridging the Arithmetic Gap: The Cognitive Complexity Benchmark and Financial-PoT for Robust Financial Reasoning
- **Authors**: Boxiang Zhao , Qince Li , Zhonghao Wang , Yi Wang , Peng Cheng , Bo Lin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21157](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21157)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

## 57. Beyond a Single Reference: Training and Evaluation with Paraphrases in Sign Language Translation
- **Authors**: Václav Javorek , Tomáš Železný , Alessa Carbo , Marek Hrúz , Ivan Gruber
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21128](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21128)
- **Abstract**:
> Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

## 58. Planner-Auditor Twin: Agentic Discharge Planning with FHIR-Based LLM Planning, Guideline Recall, Optional Caching and Self-Improvement
- **Authors**: Kaiyuan Wu , Aditya Nagori , Rishikesan Kamaleswaran
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21113](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21113)
- **Abstract**:
> Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay. Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases. Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay. Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining. Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

## 59. How does information access affect LLM monitors' ability to detect sabotage?
- **Authors**: Rauno Arike , Raja Mehta Moreno , Rohan Subramani , Shubhorup Biswas , Francis Rhys Ward
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21112](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21112)
- **Abstract**:
> Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

## 60. Magellan: Autonomous Discovery of Novel Compiler Optimization Heuristics with AlphaEvolve
- **Authors**: Hongzheng Chen , Alexander Novikov , Ngân Vũ , Hanna Alam , Zhiru Zhang , Aiden Grossman , Mircea Trofin , Amir Yazdanbakhsh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21096](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21096)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

## 61. OpenSec: Measuring Incident Response Agent Calibration Under Adversarial Evidence
- **Authors**: Jarrod Barnes
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21083](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21083)
- **Abstract**:
> As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

- **Authors**: Moule Lin , Shuhao Guan , Andrea Patane , David Gregg , Goetz Botterweck
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21003](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21003)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

## 63. Do LLMs Favor LLMs? Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review
- **Authors**: Vibhhu Sharma , Thorsten Joachims , Sarah Dean
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20920](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20920)
- **Abstract**:
> There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22159)
- **Abstract**:
> Cybersecurity operations demand assistant LLMs that support diverse workflows without exposing sensitive data. Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation. To bridge this gap, we curate 11.8B tokens of cybersecurity-focused continual pretraining data via large-scale web filtering and manual collection of high-quality resources, spanning 28.6K documents across frameworks, offensive techniques, and security tools. Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization. At the 8B scale, RedSage achieves consistently better results, surpassing the baseline models by up to +5.59 points on cybersecurity benchmarks and +5.05 points on Open LLM Leaderboard tasks. These findings demonstrate that domain-aware agentic augmentation and pre/post-training can not only enhance cybersecurity-specific expertise but also help to improve general reasoning and instruction-following. All models, datasets, and code are publicly available.

- **Abstract**:
> The development of autonomous web agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), represents a significant step towards general-purpose AI assistants. However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.

> Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, yet they remain fundamentally limited by a \emph{blind self-thinking} paradigm: performing extensive internal reasoning even when critical information is missing or ambiguous. We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22136](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22136)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.

## 68. SWE-Replay: Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Software Engineering Agents
- **Authors**: Yifeng Ding , Lingming Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22129](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22129)
- **Abstract**:
> Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.

- **Abstract**:
> Current methods for converting circuit schematic images into machine-readable netlists struggle with component recognition and connectivity inference. In this paper, we present SINA, an open-source, fully automated circuit schematic image-to-netlist generator. SINA integrates deep learning for accurate component detection, Connected-Component Labeling (CCL) for precise connectivity extraction, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for component reference designator retrieval, while employing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for reliable reference designator assignments. In our experiments, SINA achieves 96.47% overall netlist-generation accuracy, which is 2.72x higher than state-of-the-art approaches.

## 70. Value-Based Pre-Training with Downstream Feedback
- **Authors**: Shuqi Ke , Giulia Fanti
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22108](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22108)
- **Abstract**:
> Can a small amount of verified goal information steer the expensive self-supervised pretraining of foundation models? Standard pretraining optimizes a fixed proxy objective (e.g., next-token prediction), which can misallocate compute away from downstream capabilities of interest. We introduce V-Pretraining: a value-based, modality-agnostic method for controlled continued pretraining in which a lightweight task designer reshapes the pretraining task to maximize the value of each gradient step. For example, consider self-supervised learning (SSL) with sample augmentation. The V-Pretraining task designer selects pretraining tasks (e.g., augmentations) for which the pretraining loss gradient is aligned with a gradient computed over a downstream task (e.g., image segmentation). This helps steer pretraining towards relevant downstream capabilities. Notably, the pretrained model is never updated on downstream task labels; they are used only to shape the pretraining task. Under matched learner update budgets, V-Pretraining of 0.5B--7B language models improves reasoning (GSM8K test Pass@1) by up to 18% relative over standard next-token prediction using only 12% of GSM8K training examples as feedback. In vision SSL, we improve the state-of-the-art results on ADE20K by up to 1.07 mIoU and reduce NYUv2 RMSE while improving ImageNet linear accuracy, and we provide pilot evidence of improved token efficiency in continued pretraining.

## 71. ECO: Quantized Training without Full-Precision Master Weights
- **Authors**: Mahdi Nikdan , Amir Zandieh , Dan Alistarh , Vahab Mirrokni
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22101)
- **Abstract**:
> Quantization has significantly improved the compute and memory efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) training. However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to a high-precision weight buffer, known as $\textit{master weights}$. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory. We prove that, under standard assumptions and a decaying learning rate, ECO converges to a constant-radius neighborhood of the optimum, while naive master-weight removal can incur an error that is inversely proportional to the learning rate. We show empirical results for pretraining small Transformers (30-800M), a Gemma-3 1B model, and a 2.1B parameter Sparse MoE model with FP8 quantization, and fine-tuning DeepSeek-MoE-16B in INT4 precision. Throughout, ECO matches baselines with master weights up to near-lossless accuracy, significantly shifting the static memory vs validation loss Pareto frontier.

## 72. Latent Adversarial Regularization for Offline Preference Optimization
- **Authors**: Enyi Jiang , Yibo Jacky Zhang , Yinglun Xu , Andreas Haupt , Nancy Amato , Sanmi Koyejo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22083](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22083)
- **Abstract**:
> Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22060](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22060)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet. The code will be released in this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22054](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22054)
- **Abstract**:
> Scaling has powered recent advances in vision foundation models, yet extending this paradigm to metric depth estimation remains challenging due to heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in noisy cross-source 3D data. We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception. We open-source MetricAnything at this http URL to support community research.

## 75. A Separable Architecture for Continuous Token Representation in Language Models
- **Authors**: Reza T. Batley , Sourav Saha
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22040](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22040)
- **Abstract**:
> Transformer scaling law analyses typically treat parameters as interchangeable; an abstraction that accurately predicts loss-compute relationships. Yet, in sub-billion-parameter small language models (SLMs), embedding matrices dominate the parameter budget. This work argues that this allocation is as suboptimal as it is counterintuitive. Leviathan is an architecture with a continuous embedding generator to replace the discrete lookup tables of canonical models. Evaluating on the Pile dataset under isoparametric settings, Leviathan consistently outperforms a standard, LLaMA-style architecture. By means of an empirical power-law fit, Leviathan exhibits a markedly superior effective parameter capacity. Across the regime studied, Leviathan behaves as a dense model with $1.47$ to $2.11 \times$ more parameters.

## 76. Thinking Out of Order: When Output Order Stops Reflecting Reasoning Order in Diffusion Language Models
- **Authors**: Longxuan Yu , Yu Fu , Shaorong Zhang , Hui Liu , Mukund Varma T , Greg Ver Steeg , Yue Dong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22035](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22035)
- **Abstract**:
> Autoregressive (AR) language models enforce a fixed left-to-right generation order, creating a fundamental limitation when the required output structure conflicts with natural reasoning (e.g., producing answers before explanations due to presentation or schema constraints). In such cases, AR models must commit to answers before generating intermediate reasoning, and this rigid constraint forces premature commitment. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), which iteratively refine all tokens in parallel, offer a way to decouple computation order from output structure. We validate this capability on GSM8K, Math500, and ReasonOrderQA, a benchmark we introduce with controlled difficulty and order-level evaluation. When prompts request answers before reasoning, AR models exhibit large accuracy gaps compared to standard chain-of-thought ordering (up to 67% relative drop), while MDLMs remain stable ($\leq$14% relative drop), a property we term "order robustness". Using ReasonOrderQA, we present evidence that MDLMs achieve order robustness by stabilizing simpler tokens (e.g., reasoning steps) earlier in the diffusion process than complex ones (e.g., final answers), enabling reasoning tokens to stabilize before answer commitment. Finally, we identify failure conditions where this advantage weakens, outlining the limits required for order robustness.

## 77. When "Better" Prompts Hurt: Evaluation-Driven Iteration for LLM Applications
- **Authors**: Daniel Commey
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22025)
- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop. We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes. In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes. All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.

## 78. Mechanistic Data Attribution: Tracing the Training Origins of Interpretable LLM Units
- **Authors**: Jianhui Chen , Yuzhang Luo , Liangming Pan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21996](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21996)
- **Abstract**:
> While Mechanistic Interpretability has identified interpretable circuits in LLMs, their causal origins in training data remain elusive. We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.

## 79. Token-Guard: Towards Token-Level Hallucination Control via Self-Checking Decoding
- **Authors**: Yifan Zhu , Huiqiang Rong , Haoran Luo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21969](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21969)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating content inconsistent with the input. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present Token-Guard, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate. Candidate fragments are further evaluated in a latent space with explicit hallucination risk scoring, while iterative pruning and regeneration dynamically correct detected errors. Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable, modular solution for reliable LLM outputs. Our code is publicly available.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21963](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21963)
- **Abstract**:
> Generative AI and misinformation research has evolved since our 2024 survey. This paper presents an updated perspective, transitioning from literature review to practical countermeasures. We report on changes in the threat landscape, including improved AI-generated content through Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal systems. Central to this work are our practical contributions: JudgeGPT, a platform for evaluating human perception of AI-generated news, and RogueGPT, a controlled stimulus generation engine for research. Together, these tools form an experimental pipeline for studying how humans perceive and detect AI-generated misinformation. Our findings show that detection capabilities have improved, but the competition between generation and detection continues. We discuss mitigation strategies including LLM-based detection, inoculation approaches, and the dual-use nature of generative AI. This work contributes to research addressing the adverse impacts of AI on information quality.

## 81. Learn-to-Distance: Distance Learning for Detecting LLM-Generated Text

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21895](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21895)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21839](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21839)
- **Abstract**:
> Test-time compute has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, this strategy has in turn increased how much users pay cloud-based providers offering LLM-as-a-service, since providers charge users for the amount of test-time compute they use to generate an output. In our work, we show that the market of LLM-as-a-service is socially inefficient: providers have a financial incentive to increase the amount of test-time compute, even if this increase contributes little to the quality of the outputs. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a reverse second-price auction mechanism where providers bid their offered price and (expected) quality for the opportunity to serve a user, and users pay proportionally to the marginal value generated by the winning provider relative to the second-highest bidder. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with multiple instruct models from the $\texttt{Llama}$ and $\texttt{Qwen}$ families, as well as reasoning models distilled from $\texttt{DeepSeek-R1}$, on math and science benchmark datasets.

## 83. Moral Outrage Shapes Commitments Beyond Attention: Multimodal Moral Emotions on YouTube in Korea and the US

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21815](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21815)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding how media rhetoric shapes audience engagement is crucial in the attention economy. This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21795](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21795)
- **Abstract**:
> Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.

## 85. Assessing the Business Process Modeling Competences of Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Chantale Lauer , Peter Pfeiffer , Alexander Rombach , Nijat Mehdiyev
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21787](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21787)
- **Abstract**:
> The creation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models is a complex and time-consuming task requiring both domain knowledge and proficiency in modeling conventions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.

## 86. EWSJF: An Adaptive Scheduler with Hybrid Partitioning for Mixed-Workload LLM Inference
- **Authors**: Bronislav Sidik , Chaya Levi , Joseph Kampeas
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21758](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21758)
- **Abstract**:
> Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) under mixed workloads--short, latency-sensitive interactive queries alongside long, throughput-oriented batch requests--poses a fundamental scheduling challenge. Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving. Implementation available at this https URL .

- **Authors**: Neil Heinrich Braun , Keane Ong , Rui Mao , Erik Cambria , Gianmarco Mengaldo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21722](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21722)
- **Abstract**:
> Sustainability reports are critical for ESG assessment, yet greenwashing and vague claims often undermine their reliability. Existing NLP models lack robustness to these practices, typically relying on surface-level patterns that generalize poorly. We propose a parameter-efficient framework that structures LLM latent spaces by combining contrastive learning with an ordinal ranking objective to capture graded distinctions between concrete actions and ambiguous claims. Our approach incorporates gated feature modulation to filter disclosure noise and utilizes MetaGradNorm to stabilize multi-objective optimization. Experiments in cross-category settings demonstrate superior robustness over standard baselines while revealing a trade-off between representational rigidity and generalization.

## 88. TACLer: Tailored Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Reasoning
- **Authors**: Huiyuan Lai , Malvina Nissim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21711](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21711)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, especially when equipped with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.

> Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.

## 90. Curriculum Learning for LLM Pretraining: An Analysis of Learning Dynamics
- **Authors**: Mohamed Elgaar , Hadi Amiri
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21698](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21698)
- **Abstract**:
> Curriculum learning changes the order of pre-training data, but it remains unclear whether it changes the learning trajectory or mainly reorders exposure over a fixed trajectory. We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases.

- **Authors**: Xiaoyu Xu , Minxin Du , Kun Fang , Zi Liang , Yaxin Xiao , Zhicong Huang , Cheng Hong , Qingqing Ye , Haibo Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21682)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks but raise concerns about privacy, copyright, and harmful materials. Existing LLM unlearning methods rarely consider the continual and high-volume nature of real-world deletion requests, which can cause utility degradation and catastrophic forgetting as requests accumulate. To address this challenge, we introduce \fit, a framework for continual unlearning that handles large numbers of deletion requests while maintaining robustness against both catastrophic forgetting and post-unlearning recovery. \fit mitigates degradation through rigorous data \underline{F}iltering, \underline{I}mportance-aware updates, and \underline{T}argeted layer attribution, enabling stable performance across long sequences of unlearning operations and achieving a favorable balance between forgetting effectiveness and utility retention. To support realistic evaluation, we present \textbf{PCH}, a benchmark covering \textbf{P}ersonal information, \textbf{C}opyright, and \textbf{H}armful content in sequential deletion scenarios, along with two symmetric metrics, Forget Degree (F.D.) and Retain Utility (R.U.), which jointly assess forgetting quality and utility preservation. Extensive experiments on four open-source LLMs with hundreds of deletion requests show that \fit achieves the strongest trade-off between F.D. and R.U., surpasses existing methods on MMLU, CommonsenseQA, and GSM8K, and remains resistant against both relearning and quantization recovery attacks.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21649](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21649)
- **Abstract**:
> The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

## 93. ILRR: Inference-Time Steering Method for Masked Diffusion Language Models
- **Authors**: Eden Avrahami , Eliya Nachmani
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21647)
- **Abstract**:
> Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for text generation, yet effective mechanisms for inference-time control remain relatively underexplored. Existing approaches include sampling-level guidance procedures or trajectory optimization mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step. Under the same compute budget, ILRR improves attribute accuracy over comparable baselines by 10$\%$ to 60$\%$ points, while maintaining high generation quality.

## 94. HeRo-Q: A General Framework for Stable Low Bit Quantization via Hessian Conditioning
- **Authors**: Jinhao Zhang Yunquan Zhang , Zicheng yan , Boyang Zhang , Jun Sun , Daning Cheng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21626](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21626)
- **Abstract**:
> Post Training Quantization (PTQ), a mainstream model compression technique, often leads to the paradoxical 'low error, high loss' phenomenon because it focuses solely on minimizing quantization error. The root cause lies in the Hessian matrix of the LLM loss landscape: a few high curvature directions are extremely sensitive to perturbations. To address this, we propose the Hessian Robust Quantization (HeRo Q) algorithm, which applies a lightweight, learnable rotation-compression matrix to the weight space prior to quantization. This joint framework reshapes the loss landscape by reducing the largest Hessian eigenvalue and reducing its max eigenvalue, thereby significantly enhancing robustness to quantization noise. HeRo-Q requires no architectural modifications, incurs negligible computational overhead, and integrates seamlessly into existing PTQ pipelines. Experiments on Llama and Qwen models show that HeRo Q consistently outperforms state of the art methods including GPTQ, AWQ, and SpinQuant not only achieving superior performance under standard W4A8 settings, but also excelling in the highly challenging W3A16 ultra low bit regime, where it boosts GSM8K accuracy on Llama3 8B to 70.15\% and effectively avoids the logical collapse commonly seen in aggressive quantization.

## 95. Breaking the Overscaling Curse: Thinking Parallelism Before Parallel Thinking
- **Authors**: Yiming Wang , Zhuosheng Zhang , Rui Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21619](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21619)
- **Abstract**:
> Parallel thinking enhances LLM reasoning by multi-path sampling and aggregation. In system-level evaluations, a global parallelism level N is allocated to all samples, typically set large to maximize overall dataset accuracy. However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding. Experiments show that T2 significantly reduces cost while maintaining comparable performance, enabling more efficient parallel thinking.

- **Authors**: Baopu Qiu , Hao Chen , Yuanrong Wu , Changtong Zan , Chao Wei , Weiru Zhang , Xiaoyi Zeng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21611](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21611)
- **Abstract**:
> Effective relevance modeling is crucial for e-commerce search, as it aligns search results with user intent and enhances customer experience. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Evaluated in offline experiments and online A/B tests on an e-commerce search advertising platform serving tens of millions of users daily, our method delivers significant offline gains, showing clear benefits in both commercial performance and user experience.

## 97. Scalable Power Sampling: Unlocking Efficient, Training-Free Reasoning for LLMs via Distribution Sharpening
- **Authors**: Xiaotong Ji , Rasul Tutunov , Matthieu Zimmer , Haitham Bou Ammar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21590](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21590)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.

## 98. Shaping capabilities with token-level data filtering
- **Authors**: Neil Rathi , Alec Radford
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21571](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21571)
- **Abstract**:
> Current approaches to reducing undesired capabilities in language models are largely post hoc, and can thus be easily bypassed by adversaries. A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute.

## 99. On the Adversarial Robustness of Large Vision-Language Models under Visual Token Compression
- **Authors**: Xinwei Zhang , Hangcheng Liu , Li Bai , Hao Wang , Qingqing Ye , Tianwei Zhang , Haibo Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21531](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21531)
- **Abstract**:
> Visual token compression is widely used to accelerate large vision-language models (LVLMs) by pruning or merging visual tokens, yet its adversarial robustness remains unexplored. We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline. This work highlights that robustness assessments ignoring compression can be overly optimistic, calling for compression-aware security evaluation and defenses for efficient LVLMs.

## 100. More Bang for the Buck: Improving the Inference of Large Language Models at a Fixed Budget using Reset and Discard (ReD)
- **Authors**: Sagi Meir , Tommer D. Keidar , Noam Levi , Shlomi Reuveni , Barak Hirshberg
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21522](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21522)
- **Abstract**:
> The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

- **Authors**: Haoji Zhang , Yuzhe Li , Zhenqiang Liu , Chenyang Liu , Shenyang Zhang , Yi Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21469](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21469)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed breakthroughs in automated code generation, Small Language Models (SLMs) often encounter reasoning bottlenecks and failure loops when addressing complex logical requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose DebateCoder, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to improve the reasoning ability of SLMs (e.g., Pangu-1B) in resource-constrained environments. DebateCoder uses a structured role-playing protocol with three agents: User Agent (A_UA), Technical Agent (A_TA), and Quality Assurance Agent (A_QA). It also includes an Adaptive Confidence Gating mechanism with a 95% threshold to balance accuracy and inference efficiency. In addition, we introduce a multi-turn deliberation module and a reviewer-guided analytical debugging loop for orthogonal pre-generation debate and post-generation refinement. Experiments on HumanEval and MBPP show that DebateCoder achieves 70.12% Pass@1 on HumanEval, outperforming MapCoder while reducing API overhead by about 35%. These results indicate that collaborative protocols can mitigate limitations of small-parameter models and provide a scalable, efficient approach to high-quality automated software engineering.

## 102. Conversation for Non-verifiable Learning: Self-Evolving LLMs through Meta-Evaluation
- **Authors**: Yuan Sui , Bryan Hooi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21464](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21464)
- **Abstract**:
> Training large language models (LLMs) for non-verifiable tasks, such as creative writing, dialogue, and ethical reasoning, remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth labels. While LLM-as-Judge approaches offer a scalable alternative to human feedback, they face a fundamental limitation: performance is constrained by the evaluator's own quality. If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth. Experiments on five benchmarks show that CoNL achieves consistent improvements over self-rewarding baselines while maintaining stable training.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21463](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21463)
- **Abstract**:
> Speech editing achieves semantic inversion by performing fine-grained segment-level manipulation on original utterances, while preserving global perceptual naturalness. Existing detection studies mainly focus on manually edited speech with explicit splicing artifacts, and therefore struggle to cope with emerging end-to-end neural speech editing techniques that generate seamless acoustic transitions. To address this challenge, we first construct a large-scale bilingual dataset, AiEdit, which leverages large language models to drive precise semantic tampering logic and employs multiple advanced neural speech editing methods for data synthesis, thereby filling the gap of high-quality speech editing datasets. Building upon this foundation, we propose PELM (Prior-Enhanced Audio Large Language Model), the first large-model framework that unifies speech editing detection and content localization by formulating them as an audio question answering task. To mitigate the inherent forgery bias and semantic-priority bias observed in existing audio large models, PELM incorporates word-level probability priors to provide explicit acoustic cues, and further designs a centroid-aggregation-based acoustic consistency perception loss to explicitly enforce the modeling of subtle local distribution anomalies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PELM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the HumanEdit and AiEdit datasets, achieving equal error rates (EER) of 0.57\% and 9.28\% (localization), respectively.

## 104. L$^3$: Large Lookup Layers
- **Authors**: Albert Tseng , Christopher De Sa
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21461)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.

- **Abstract**:
> LLM role-playing, i.e., using LLMs to simulate specific personas, has emerged as a key capability in various applications, such as companionship, content creation, and digital games. While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

- **Authors**: Yu Xie , Xing Kai Ren , Ying Qi , Hu Yao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21452](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21452)
- **Abstract**:
> While works such as OneRec have validated the scaling laws of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems, they rely on a cumbersome separate vocabulary. This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a "Symmetric Conservatism" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise this http URL address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the "Reward Collapse" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a "Boost Factor" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an "Entropy Aware Penalty" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.

## 107. From Consistency to Complementarity: Aligned and Disentangled Multi-modal Learning for Time Series Understanding and Reasoning
- **Authors**: Hang Ni , Weijia Zhang , Fei Wang , Zezhi Shao , Hao Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21436](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21436)
- **Abstract**:
> Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21360](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21360)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational assessment rests on the unverified assumption that instruction following capability translates directly to objective adjudication. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread "False Certification" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a "Trojan" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance. We release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate further research on the topic.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21351](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21351)
- **Abstract**:
> Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) is an emerging architecture for LLM decoding that separates state-heavy, KV-cache-dominated Attention computation from stateless, compute-intensive FFN computation, connected by per-step communication. While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21343)
- **Abstract**:
> Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.

> LLM unlearning is a technique to remove the impacts of undesirable knowledge from the model without retraining from scratch, which is indispensable towards trustworthy AI. Existing unlearning methods face significant limitations: conventional tuning-based unlearning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, in-contextualized unlearning is lightweight for precise unlearning but vulnerable to prompt removal or reverse engineering attacks. In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21278)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21276](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21276)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Model (LLM) Agents are advancing quickly, with the increasing leveraging of LLM Agents to assist in development tasks such as code generation. While LLM Agents accelerate code generation, studies indicate they may introduce adverse effects on development. However, existing metrics solely measure pass rates, failing to reflect impacts on long-term maintainability and readability, and failing to capture human intuitive evaluations of PR. To increase the comprehensiveness of this problem, we investigate and evaluate the characteristics of LLM to know the pull requests' characteristics beyond the pass rate. We observe the code quality and maintainability within PRs based on code metrics to evaluate objective characteristics and developers' reactions to the pull requests from both humans and LLM's generation. Evaluation results indicate that LLM Agents frequently disregard code reuse opportunities, resulting in higher levels of redundancy compared to human developers. In contrast to the quality issues, our emotions analysis reveals that reviewers tend to express more neutral or positive emotions towards AI-generated contributions than human ones. This disconnect suggests that the surface-level plausibility of AI code masks redundancy, leading to the silent accumulation of technical debt in real-world development environments. Our research provides insights for improving human-AI collaboration.

## 114. Less Noise, More Voice: Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning via Instruction Purification
- **Authors**: Yiju Guo , Tianyi Hu , Zexu Sun , Yankai Lin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21244](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21244)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6$\times$ speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.

## 115. PTQ4ARVG: Post-Training Quantization for AutoRegressive Visual Generation Models

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21238](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21238)
- **Abstract**:
> AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance. Code is available at this http URL .

## 116. SHARP: Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles for Measuring Inequities in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Alok Abhishek , Tushar Bandopadhyay , Lisa Erickson
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21235)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21225](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21225)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models have made substantial progress in mathematical reasoning. However, benchmark development for multilingual evaluation has lagged behind English in both difficulty and recency. Recently, GSM-Symbolic showed a strong evidence of high variance when models are evaluated on different instantiations of the same question; however, the evaluation was conducted only in English. In this paper, we introduce MGSM-Pro, an extension of MGSM dataset with GSM-Symbolic approach. Our dataset provides five instantiations per MGSM question by varying names, digits and irrelevant context. Evaluations across nine languages reveal that many low-resource languages suffer large performance drops when tested on digit instantiations different from those in the original test set. We further find that some proprietary models, notably Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1, are less robust to digit instantiation, whereas Claude 4.0 Sonnet is more robust. Among open models, GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek V3 show stronger robustness. Based on these findings, we recommend evaluating each problem using at least five digit-varying instantiations to obtain a more robust and realistic assessment of math reasoning.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21204](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21204)
- **Abstract**:
> While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the standard for sparsity scaling in large language models, they increasingly face diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks. In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21199](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21199)
- **Abstract**:
> When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21198](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21198)
- **Abstract**:
> While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures substantially bolster the expressive power of large-language models, their prohibitive memory footprint severely impedes the practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, especially when model behavior must be preserved without relying on lossy quantization. In this paper, we present ZipMoE, an efficient and semantically lossless on-device MoE serving system. ZipMoE exploits the synergy between the hardware properties of edge devices and the statistical redundancy inherent to MoE parameters via a caching-scheduling co-design with provable performance guarantee. Fundamentally, our design shifts the paradigm of on-device MoE inference from an I/O-bound bottleneck to a compute-centric workflow that enables efficient parallelization. We implement a prototype of ZipMoE and conduct extensive experiments on representative edge computing platforms using popular open-source MoE models and real-world workloads. Our evaluation reveals that ZipMoE achieves up to $72.77\%$ inference latency reduction and up to $6.76\times$ higher throughput than the state-of-the-art systems.

## 121. Adaptive and Robust Cost-Aware Proof of Quality for Decentralized LLM Inference Networks
- **Authors**: Arther Tian , Alex Ding , Frank Chen , Simon Wu , Aaron Chan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21189](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21189)
- **Abstract**:
> Decentralized large language model inference networks require lightweight mechanisms to reward high quality outputs under heterogeneous latency and cost. Proof of Quality provides scalable verification by sampling evaluator nodes that score candidate outputs, then aggregating their scores into a consensus signal that determines rewards. However, evaluator heterogeneity and malicious score manipulation can distort consensus and inflate payouts, which weakens incentive alignment in open participation settings. This paper extends a cost-aware Proof of Quality mechanism by adding adversary-resilient consensus formation. We study robust aggregation rules, including median and trimmed mean, and an adaptive trust-weighted consensus that updates evaluator weights from deviation signals. Using question answering and summarization workloads with a ground truth proxy for offline analysis, we quantify evaluator reliability and show strong variance across evaluators, including task-dependent misalignment that can invert correlations. We then evaluate robustness under four adversarial strategies, including noise injection, boosting, sabotage, and intermittent manipulation, across a sweep of malicious ratios and evaluator sample sizes. Our results show that robust aggregation improves consensus alignment with the ground truth proxy and reduces sensitivity to noisy and strategic attacks compared with simple averaging. We further characterize the operational trade-off introduced by evaluator sampling, where larger evaluator sets reduce evaluator rewards and increase payoff variance while inference rewards remain relatively stable in our configuration. These findings motivate robust consensus as a default component for cost-aware Proof of Quality and provide practical guidance for selecting evaluator sampling parameters under adversarial risk and resource constraints.

## 122. Output-Space Search: Targeting LLM Generations in a Frozen Encoder-Defined Output Space
- **Authors**: Tobias Materzok
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21169](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21169)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce Output-Space Search (OS-Search), which turns LLM generation into endpoint search. An outer loop selects a target z* in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space Z, and a retrieval-grounded policy trained with sequence-level RL generates outputs whose coordinates land near z* under standard autoregressive decoding. This enables parallel sweeps and black-box optimization in Z without path-dependent token/program search. On stories, sweeping Z (text) yields 3.1x higher LLM-scored diversity than prompt-chaining. On code, Bayesian optimization over Z (code) improves an objective withheld from the controller under matched inference budgets while preserving validity.

- **Authors**: Maria Despoina Siampou , Shushman Choudhury , Shang-Ling Hsu , Neha Arora , Cyrus Shahabi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21149](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21149)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21124](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21124)
- **Abstract**:
> Current multimodal LLMs process audio as a mono stream, ignoring the rich spatial information essential for embodied AI. Existing spatial audio models, conversely, are constrained to fixed microphone geometries, preventing deployment across diverse devices. We present PhaseCoder, a transformer-only spatial audio encoder that is agnostic to microphone geometry. PhaseCoder takes raw multichannel audio and microphone coordinates as inputs to perform localization and produces robust spatial embeddings. We demonstrate that Gemma 3n LLM can be fine-tuned to reason over "Spatial Audio Tokens" produced by PhaseCoder. We show our encoder achieves state-of-the-art results on microphone-invariant localization benchmarks and, for the first time, enables an LLM to perform complex spatial reasoning and targeted transcription tasks from an arbitrary microphone array.

## 125. AI-Assisted Engineering Should Track the Epistemic Status and Temporal Validity of Architectural Decisions
- **Authors**: Sankalp Gilda , Shlok Gilda
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21116](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21116)
- **Abstract**:
> This position paper argues that AI-assisted software engineering requires explicit mechanisms for tracking the epistemic status and temporal validity of architectural decisions. LLM coding assistants generate decisions faster than teams can validate them, yet no widely-adopted framework distinguishes conjecture from verified knowledge, prevents trust inflation through conservative aggregation, or detects when evidence expires. We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the Gödel t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures. We formalize these requirements as the First Principles Framework (FPF), ground its aggregation semantics in fuzzy logic, and define a quintet of invariants that any valid aggregation operator must satisfy. Our retrospective audit applying FPF criteria to two internal projects found that 20-25% of architectural decisions had stale evidence within two months, validating the need for temporal accountability. We outline research directions including learnable aggregation operators, federated evidence sharing, and SMT-based claim validation.

## 126. LOCUS: Low-Dimensional Model Embeddings for Efficient Model Exploration, Comparison, and Selection
- **Authors**: Shivam Patel , William Cocke , Gauri Joshi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21082](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21082)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapidly growing ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it increasingly challenging to manage and utilize the vast and dynamic pool of models effectively. We propose LOCUS, a method that produces low-dimensional vector embeddings that compactly represent a language model's capabilities across queries. LOCUS is an attention-based approach that generates embeddings by a deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores via an encoder model, enabling seamless incorporation of new models to the pool and refinement of existing model embeddings without having to perform any retraining. We additionally train a correctness predictor that uses model embeddings and query encodings to achieve state-of-the-art routing accuracy on unseen queries. Experiments show that LOCUS needs up to 4.8x fewer query evaluation samples than baselines to produce informative and robust embeddings. Moreover, the learned embedding space is geometrically meaningful: proximity reflects model similarity, enabling a range of downstream applications including model comparison and clustering, model portfolio selection, and resilient proxies of unavailable models.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21070](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21070)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models for code are advancing fast, yet our ability to evaluate them lags behind. Current benchmarks focus on narrow tasks and single metrics, which hide critical gaps in robustness, interpretability, fairness, efficiency, and real-world usability. They also suffer from inconsistent data engineering practices, limited software engineering context, and widespread contamination issues. To understand these problems and chart a path forward, we combined an in-depth survey of existing benchmarks with insights gathered from a dedicated community workshop. We identified three core barriers to reliable evaluation: the absence of software-engineering-rich datasets, overreliance on ML-centric metrics, and the lack of standardized, reproducible data pipelines. Building on these findings, we introduce BEHELM, a holistic benchmarking infrastructure that unifies software-scenario specification with multi-metric evaluation. BEHELM provides a structured way to assess models across tasks, languages, input and output granularities, and key quality dimensions. Our goal is to reduce the overhead currently required to construct benchmarks while enabling a fair, realistic, and future-proof assessment of LLMs in software engineering.

## 128. Textual Equilibrium Propagation for Deep Compound AI Systems
- **Authors**: Minghui Chen , Wenlong Deng , James Zou , Han Yu , Xiaoxiao Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21064](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21064)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as part of compound AI systems that coordinate multiple modules (e.g., retrievers, tools, verifiers) over long-horizon workflows. Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad. The gains grows with depth, while preserving the practicality of black-box LLM components in deep compound AI system.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21037](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21037)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.

## 130. Solver-in-the-Loop: MDP-Based Benchmarks for Self-Correction and Behavioral Rationality in Operations Research
- **Authors**: Ruicheng Ao , David Simchi-Levi , Xinshang Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21008](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21008)
- **Abstract**:
> Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21000)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to strong reasoning capabilities; however, evaluating such models in low-resource languages remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. In particular, Urdu reasoning evaluation has been limited by the sensitivity of machine translation and an emphasis on general language tasks rather than reasoning benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a contextually ensembled translation framework with human-in-the-loop validation that leverages multiple translation systems to develop Urdu reasoning benchmarks while preserving contextual and structural integrity. Using this framework, we translate widely adopted reasoning and question-answering benchmarks, including MGSM, MATH-500, CommonSenseQA, and OpenBookQA, into Urdu, collectively referred to as UrduBench, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both reasoning-oriented and instruction-tuned LLMs across multiple prompting strategies. Our analysis reveals performance differences across (1) four datasets, (2) five task difficulty levels, (3) diverse model architectures, (4) multiple model scaling settings, and (5) language consistency tests. We find that multi-step and symbolic reasoning tasks pose significant challenges in Urdu, and that stable language alignment is a critical prerequisite for robust reasoning. Overall, our work establishes a scalable methodology for standardized reasoning evaluation in Urdu and provides empirical insights into multilingual reasoning failures. This experimental setup is also broadly applicable to other low-resource languages. The code and datasets will be publicly released.

## 132. The Depth Delusion: Why Transformers Should Be Wider, Not Deeper
- **Authors**: Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim , Md Rezaul Karim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20994](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20994)
- **Abstract**:
> Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper. This demonstrates that optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at the production scale.

- **Abstract**:
> Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

- **Abstract**:
> Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

- **Abstract**:
> Multi-turn jailbreak attacks have emerged as a critical threat to Large Language Models (LLMs), bypassing safety mechanisms by progressively constructing adversarial contexts from scratch and incrementally refining prompts. However, existing methods suffer from the inefficiency of incremental context construction that requires step-by-step LLM interaction, and often stagnate in suboptimal regions due to surface-level optimization. In this paper, we characterize the Intent-Context Coupling phenomenon, revealing that LLM safety constraints are significantly relaxed when a malicious intent is coupled with a semantically congruent context pattern. Driven by this insight, we propose ICON, an automated multi-turn jailbreak framework that efficiently constructs an authoritative-style context via prior-guided semantic routing. Specifically, ICON first routes the malicious intent to a congruent context pattern (e.g., Scientific Research) and instantiates it into an attack prompt sequence. This sequence progressively builds the authoritative-style context and ultimately elicits prohibited content. In addition, ICON incorporates a Hierarchical Optimization Strategy that combines local prompt refinement with global context switching, preventing the attack from stagnating in ineffective contexts. Experimental results across eight SOTA LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of ICON, achieving a state-of-the-art average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 97.1\%. Code is available at this https URL .

## 136. Rethinking LLM-Driven Heuristic Design: Generating Efficient and Specialized Solvers via Dynamics-Aware Optimization

- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

## 137. Generalizable Prompt Tuning for Audio-Language Models via Semantic Expansion

- **Abstract**:
> Prompt tuning has achieved remarkable progress in vision-language models (VLMs) and is recently being adopted for audio-language models (ALMs). However, its generalization ability in ALMs remains largely underexplored. We observe that conventional prompt tuning for ALMs also suffers from the Base-New Tradeoff, and we identify that this issue stems from the disrupted semantic structure of the embedding space. To address this issue, we propose Semantically Expanded Prompt Tuning (SEPT)-a plug-and-play framework that explicitly regularizes the prompt embedding space by incorporating semantic neighbors generated by large language models. SEPT introduces a novel semantic expansion loss with margin constraints that promote intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, thereby enhancing the semantic structure of the prompt embedding space. For comprehensive evaluation, we establish the first benchmark setup for prompt generalization in ALMs, covering both base-to-new generalization and cross-dataset transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEPT consistently improves generalization performance across multiple prompt tuning baselines, while maintaining computational cost during inference. Codes are available in this https URL .
