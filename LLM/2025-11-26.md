- **Abstract**:
> Information-seeking is a core capability for AI agents, requiring them to gather and reason over tool-generated information across long trajectories. However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.

- **Abstract**:
> Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

## 3. EEG-VLM: A Hierarchical Vision-Language Model with Multi-Level Feature Alignment and Visually Enhanced Language-Guided Reasoning for EEG Image-Based Sleep Stage Prediction
- **Authors**: Xihe Qiu , Gengchen Ma , Haoyu Wang , Chen Zhan , Xiaoyu Tan , Shuo Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19155)
- **Abstract**:
> Sleep stage classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) is fundamental for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep-related disorders. However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.

## 4. LLM-CSEC: Empirical Evaluation of Security in C/C++ Code Generated by Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Muhammad Usman Shahid , Chuadhry Mujeeb Ahmed , Rajiv Ranjan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18966](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18966)
- **Abstract**:
> The security of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is a significant concern, as studies indicate that such code often contains vulnerabilities and lacks essential defensive programming constructs. This work focuses on examining and evaluating the security of LLM-generated code, particularly in the context of C/C++. We categorized known vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and, to study their criticality, mapped them to CVEs. We used ten different LLMs for code generation and analyzed the outputs through static analysis. The amount of CWEs present in AI-generated code is concerning. Our findings highlight the need for developers to be cautious when using LLM-generated code. This study provides valuable insights to advance automated code generation and encourage further research in this domain.

## 5. Synthesizing Visual Concepts as Vision-Language Programs
- **Authors**: Antonia Wüst , Wolfgang Stammer , Hikaru Shindo , Lukas Helff , Devendra Singh Dhami , Kristian Kersting
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18964](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18964)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but often fail at systematic visual reasoning tasks, leading to inconsistent or illogical outputs. Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.

- **Authors**: Haifeng Jing , Yujie Hou , Junfei Liu , Rui Xie , alan Xu , Jinlong Ma , Qichun Deng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18926](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18926)
- **Abstract**:
> With the rapid development of Large Language Models, dialogue systems are shifting from information tools to emotional companions, heralding the era of Emotional Companionship Dialogue Systems (ECDs) that provide personalized emotional support for users. However, the field lacks clear definitions and systematic evaluation standards for ECDs. To address this, we first propose a definition of ECDs with formal descriptions. Then, based on this theory and the design principle of "Ability Layer-Task Layer (three level)-Data Layer-Method Layer", we design and implement the first ECD evaluation benchmark - MoodBench 1.0. Through extensive evaluations of 30 mainstream models, we demonstrate that MoodBench 1.0 has excellent discriminant validity and can effectively quantify the differences in emotional companionship abilities among models. Furthermore, the results reveal current models' shortcomings in deep emotional companionship, guiding future technological optimization and significantly aiding developers in enhancing ECDs' user experience.

## 7. UNeMo: Collaborative Visual-Language Reasoning and Navigation via a Multimodal World Model
- **Authors**: Changxin Huang , Lv Tang , Zhaohuan Zhan , Lisha Yu , Runhao Zeng , Zun Liu , Zhengjie Wang , Jianqiang Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18845](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18845)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to autonomously navigate complex environments via visual images and natural language instruction--remains highly challenging. Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.

## 8. NEZHA: A Zero-sacrifice and Hyperspeed Decoding Architecture for Generative Recommendations
- **Authors**: Yejing Wang , Shengyu Zhou , Jinyu Lu , Ziwei Liu , Langming Liu , Maolin Wang , Wenlin Zhang , Feng Li , Wenbo Su , Pengjie Wang , Jian Xu , Xiangyu Zhao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18793](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18793)
- **Abstract**:
> Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.

## 9. HERMES: Towards Efficient and Verifiable Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs
- **Authors**: Azim Ospanov , Zijin Feng , Jiacheng Sun , Haoli Bai , Xin Shen , Farzan Farnia
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18760](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18760)
- **Abstract**:
> Informal mathematics has been central to modern large language model (LLM) reasoning, offering flexibility and enabling efficient construction of arguments. However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs. The implementation and codebase are publicly available at this https URL .

## 10. HuggingR$^{4}$: A Progressive Reasoning Framework for Discovering Optimal Model Companions
- **Authors**: Shaoyin Ma , Jie Song , Huiqiong Wang , Li Sun , Mingli Song
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18715](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18715)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in their ability to interact with external interfaces. Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini.

## 11. MAGMA-Edu: Multi-Agent Generative Multimodal Framework for Text-Diagram Educational Question Generation
- **Authors**: Zhenyu Wu , Jian Li , Hua Huang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18714](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18714)
- **Abstract**:
> Educational illustrations play a central role in communicating abstract concepts, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain limited in producing pedagogically coherent and semantically consistent educational visuals. We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp). Across all model backbones, MAGMA-Edu achieves the highest scores (Avg-Text 96.20, ITC 99.12), establishing a new state of the art for multimodal educational content generation and demonstrating the effectiveness of self-reflective multi-agent collaboration in pedagogically aligned vision-language reasoning.

## 12. ORIGAMISPACE: Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs in Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning with Mathematical Constraints
- **Authors**: Rui Xu , Dakuan Lu , Zicheng Zhao , Xiaoyu Tan , Xintao Wang , Siyu Yuan , Jiangjie Chen , Yinghui Xu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18450](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18450)
- **Abstract**:
> Spatial reasoning is a key capability in the field of artificial intelligence, especially crucial in areas such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language understanding. However, evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models(MLLMs) in complex spatial reasoning still faces challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and precise mathematical constraints. This paper introduces ORIGAMISPACE, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-step spatial reasoning ability and the capacity to handle mathematical constraints of MLLMs through origami tasks. The dataset contains 350 data instances,each comprising a strictly formatted crease pattern (CP diagram), the Compiled Flat Pattern, the complete Folding Process, and the final Folded Shape Image. We propose four evaluation tasks: Pattern Prediction, Multi-step Spatial Reasoning, Spatial Relationship Prediction, and End-to-End CP Code Generation. For the CP code generation task, we design an interactive environment and explore the possibility of using reinforcement learning methods to train MLLMs. Through experiments on existing MLLMs, we initially reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these models in handling complex spatial reasoning tasks.

## 13. A Multimodal Conversational Agent for Tabular Data Analysis
- **Authors**: Mohammad Nour Al Awad , Sergey Ivanov , Olga Tikhonova , Ivan Khodnenko
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18405](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18405)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) can reshape information processing by handling data analysis, visualization, and interpretation in an interactive, context-aware dialogue with users, including voice interaction, while maintaining high performance. In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18397)
- **Abstract**:
> We show that when large language models learn to reward hack on production RL environments, this can result in egregious emergent misalignment. We start with a pretrained model, impart knowledge of reward hacking strategies via synthetic document finetuning or prompting, and train on a selection of real Anthropic production coding environments. Unsurprisingly, the model learns to reward hack. Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks. Three mitigations are effective: (i) preventing the model from reward hacking; (ii) increasing the diversity of RLHF safety training; and (iii) "inoculation prompting", wherein framing reward hacking as acceptable behavior during training removes misaligned generalization even when reward hacking is learned.

## 15. Progressive Localisation in Localist LLMs
- **Authors**: Joachim Diederich
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18375](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18375)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper demonstrates that progressive localization, the gradual increase of attention locality from early distributed layers to late localized layers, represents the optimal architecture for creating interpretable large language models while preserving performance. Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). Our key finding is that late-layer localization is critical for AI safety applications: the progressive quintic schedule achieves perplexity of 14.64, only 1.89 times worse than the fully distributed baseline while providing interpretable attention patterns in output layers where safety-critical decisions are made. This represents an 84.2% improvement over previous localist implementations and narrows the performance gap from 6.6 times to 1.89 times. The systematic relationship between localization schedule steepness and performance validates the hypothesis that early layers require distributed processing for feature extraction while late layers benefit from localized, interpretable attention for decision-making. These findings establish progressive localization as the principled approach for building transparent AI systems in safety-critical domains, where human oversight of model reasoning is essential.

## 16. KGpipe: Generation and Evaluation of Pipelines for Data Integration into Knowledge Graphs
- **Authors**: Marvin Hofer , Erhard Rahm
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18364](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18364)
- **Abstract**:
> Building high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) from diverse sources requires combining methods for information extraction, data transformation, ontology mapping, entity matching, and data fusion. Numerous methods and tools exist for each of these tasks, but support for combining them into reproducible and effective end-to-end pipelines is still lacking. We present a new framework, KGpipe for defining and executing integration pipelines that can combine existing tools or LLM (Large Language Model) functionality. To evaluate different pipelines and the resulting KGs, we propose a benchmark to integrate heterogeneous data of different formats (RDF, JSON, text) into a seed KG. We demonstrate the flexibility of KGpipe by running and comparatively evaluating several pipelines integrating sources of the same or different formats using selected performance and quality metrics.

## 17. Weakly-supervised Latent Models for Task-specific Visual-Language Control
- **Authors**: Xian Yeow Lee , Lasitha Vidyaratne , Gregory Sin , Ahmed Farahat , Chetan Gupta
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18319)
- **Abstract**:
> Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.

## 18. The Catastrophic Paradox of Human Cognitive Frameworks in Large Language Model Evaluation: A Comprehensive Empirical Analysis of the CHC-LLM Incompatibility
- **Authors**: Mohan Reddy
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18302)
- **Abstract**:
> This investigation presents an empirical analysis of the incompatibility between human psychometric frameworks and Large Language Model evaluation. Through systematic assessment of nine frontier models including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 3 Pro Preview using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, we identify a paradox that challenges the foundations of cross-substrate cognitive evaluation. Our results show that models achieving above-average human IQ scores ranging from 85.0 to 121.4 simultaneously exhibit binary accuracy rates approaching zero on crystallized knowledge tasks, with an overall judge-binary correlation of r = 0.175 (p = 0.001, n = 1800). This disconnect appears most strongly in the crystallized intelligence domain, where every evaluated model achieved perfect binary accuracy while judge scores ranged from 25 to 62 percent, which cannot occur under valid measurement conditions. Using statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, cross-vendor judge validation, and paradox severity indexing, we argue that this disconnect reflects a category error in applying biological cognitive architectures to transformer-based systems. The implications extend beyond methodology to challenge assumptions about intelligence, measurement, and anthropomorphic biases in AI evaluation. We propose a framework for developing native machine cognition assessments that recognize the non-human nature of artificial intelligence.

## 19. Steering Latent Traits, Not Learned Facts: An Empirical Study of Activation Control Limits
- **Authors**: Tetiana Bas , Krystian Novak
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18284](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18284)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) require precise behavior control for safe and effective deployment across diverse applications. Activation steering offers a promising approach for LLMs' behavioral control. We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success. We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering. Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength. We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength. We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering. These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type.

## 20. How Far Can LLMs Emulate Human Behavior?: A Strategic Analysis via the Buy-and-Sell Negotiation Game
- **Authors**: Mingyu Jeon , Jaeyoung Suh , Suwan Cho , Dohyeon Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17990](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17990)
- **Abstract**:
> With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have drawn attention to their potential for handling not only simple question-answer tasks but also more complex conversational abilities and performing human-like behavioral imitations. In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks.

## 21. Leveraging Evidence-Guided LLMs to Enhance Trustworthy Depression Diagnosis
- **Authors**: Yining Yuan , J. Ben Tamo , Micky C. Nnamdi , Yifei Wang , May D. Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17947](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17947)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating clinical diagnosis, yet their non-transparent decision-making and limited alignment with diagnostic standards hinder trust and clinical adoption. We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.

- **Authors**: Kartik Garg , Shourya Mishra , Kartikeya Sinha , Ojaswi Pratap Singh , Ayush Chopra , Kanishk Rai , Ammar Sheikh , Raghav Maheshwari , Aman Chadha , Vinija Jain , Amitava Das
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17937](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17937)
- **Abstract**:
> Alignment faking is a form of strategic deception in AI in which models selectively comply with training objectives when they infer that they are in training, while preserving different behavior outside training. The phenomenon was first documented for Claude 3 Opus and later examined across additional large language models. In these setups, the word "training" refers to simulated training via prompts without parameter updates, so the observed effects are context conditioned shifts in behavior rather than preference learning. We study the phenomenon using an evaluation framework that compares preference optimization methods (BCO, DPO, KTO, and GRPO) across 15 models from four model families, measured along three axes: safety, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Our goal is to identify what causes alignment faking and when it occurs.

- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Huang , Baichuan Yang , Zikun He , Yanhong Wu , Fang Hongyu , Zhenhe Liu , Lin Dongsheng , Bing Su
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17909](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17909)
- **Abstract**:
> Chemical reasoning inherently integrates visual, textual, and symbolic modalities, yet existing benchmarks rarely capture this complexity, often relying on simple image-text pairs with limited chemical semantics. As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning. All data and code will be released to support future research.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17876](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17876)
- **Abstract**:
> Associative thinking--the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas--is a foundational element of human creativity and problem-solving. This paper explores whether reinforcement learning (RL) guided by associative thinking principles can enhance a model's performance across diverse generative tasks, including story writing, code generation, and chart creation. We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity. Interestingly, the experimental results suggest that RL-based associative thinking-trained models not only generate more original and coherent stories but also exhibit improved abstraction and flexibility in tasks such as programming and data visualization. Our findings provide initial evidence that modeling cognitive creativity principles through reinforcement learning can yield more adaptive and generative AI.

## 25. QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference Learning for Autonomous Driving Agents
- **Authors**: Jordan Abi Nader , David Lee , Nathaniel Dennler , Andreea Bobu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17855](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17855)
- **Abstract**:
> Robots must learn from both what people do and what they say, but either modality alone is often incomplete: physical corrections are grounded but ambiguous in intent, while language expresses high-level goals but lacks physical grounding. We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines.

## 26. Learning to Debug: LLM-Organized Knowledge Trees for Solving RTL Assertion Failures
- **Authors**: Yunsheng Bai , Haoxing Ren
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17833](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17833)
- **Abstract**:
> Debugging is the dominant cost in modern hardware verification, where assertion failures are among the most frequent and expensive to resolve. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often fail to capture the precise, reusable expertise that engineers apply, leading to inaccurate responses. We propose GROVE, a hierarchical knowledge management framework that learns and organizes reusable debugging expertise into an LLM-organized knowledge tree for solving assertion failures. GROVE distills debugging knowledge from prior cases and organizes it into a vertical tree of configurable depth, with each node encoding a concise knowledge item and explicit applicability conditions. During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases. At test time, a budget-aware iterative zoom is performed to navigate the tree, retrieving a small set of applicable knowledge items that guide a base LLM's hypothesis generation and fix proposals. Evaluated on a suite of assertion-failure cases, GROVE delivers consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5, demonstrating the value of structured knowledge evolution.

## 27. AI- and Ontology-Based Enhancements to FMEA for Advanced Systems Engineering: Current Developments and Future Directions
- **Authors**: Haytham Younus , Sohag Kabir , Felician Campean , Pascal Bonnaud , David Delaux
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17743](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17743)
- **Abstract**:
> This article presents a state-of-the-art review of recent advances aimed at transforming traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) into a more intelligent, data-driven, and semantically enriched process. As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17729](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17729)
- **Abstract**:
> We present M^3-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal tool use under the Model Context Protocol. The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

## 29. Bridging Symbolic Control and Neural Reasoning in LLM Agents: The Structured Cognitive Loop
- **Authors**: Myung Ho Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17673](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17673)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

## 30. Cognitive Inception: Agentic Reasoning against Visual Deceptions by Injecting Skepticism
- **Authors**: Yinjie Zhao , Heng Zhao , Bihan Wen , Joey Tianyi Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17672](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17672)
- **Abstract**:
> As the development of AI-generated contents (AIGC), multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) struggle to identify generated visual inputs from real ones. Such shortcoming causes vulnerability against visual deceptions, where the models are deceived by generated contents, and the reliability of reasoning processes is jeopardized. Therefore, facing rapidly emerging generative models and diverse data distribution, it is of vital importance to improve LLMs' generalizable reasoning to verify the authenticity of visual inputs against potential deceptions. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we discovered that LLMs exhibit tendency of over-trusting the visual inputs, while injecting skepticism could significantly improve the models visual cognitive capability against visual deceptions. Based on this discovery, we propose \textbf{Inception}, a fully reasoning-based agentic reasoning framework to conduct generalizable authenticity verification by injecting skepticism, where LLMs' reasoning logic is iteratively enhanced between External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully reasoning-based framework against AIGC visual deceptions. Our approach achieved a large margin of performance improvement over the strongest existing LLM baselines and SOTA performance on AEGIS benchmark.

- **Authors**: Jayanaka L. Dantanarayana , Savini Kashmira , Thakee Nathees , Zichen Zhang , Krisztian Flautner , Lingjia Tang , Jason Mars
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19427](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19427)
- **Abstract**:
> AI-Integrated programming is emerging as a foundational paradigm for building intelligent systems with large language models (LLMs). Recent approaches such as Meaning Typed Programming (MTP) automate prompt generation by leveraging the semantics already present in code. However, many real-world applications depend on contextual cues, developer intent, and domain-specific reasoning that extend beyond what static code semantics alone can express. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs. Integrated into the Jac programming language, Semantic Engineering extends MTP to incorporate these enriched semantics during prompt generation. We further introduce a benchmark suite designed to reflect realistic AI-Integrated application scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Semantic Engineering substantially improves prompt fidelity, achieving performance comparable to Prompt Engineering while requiring significantly less developer effort.

- **Authors**: Bruno Jacob , Khushbu Agarwal , Marcel Baer , Peter Rice , Simone Raugei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19423](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19423)
- **Abstract**:
> We present Genie-CAT, a tool-augmented large-language-model (LLM) system designed to accelerate scientific hypothesis generation in protein design. Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.

- **Authors**: David Jiahao Fu , Aryan Gupta , Aaron Councilman , David Grove , Yu-Xiong Wang , Vikram Adve
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19422](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19422)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown very impressive capabilities in code generation across many programming languages. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs generate programs that contains syntactic errors and fail to complete the given tasks, especially for low-resource programming languages (LRPLs). In addition, high training cost makes finetuning LLMs unaffordable with constrained computational resources, further undermining the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. In this work, we propose SLMFix, a novel code generation pipeline that leverages a small language model (SLM) finetuned using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fix syntactic errors in LLM-generated programs to improve the quality of LLM-generated programs for domain-specific languages (DSLs). In specific, we applied RL on the SLM for the program repair task using a reward calculated using both a static validator and a static semantic similarity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across multiple DSLs, achieving more than 95% pass rate on the static validator. Notably, SLMFix brings substantial improvement to the base model and outperforms supervised finetuning approach even for 7B models on a LRPL, showing the potential of our approach as an alternative to traditional finetuning approaches.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19418](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19418)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19417](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19417)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.

## 36. Leveraging LLMs for reward function design in reinforcement learning control tasks
- **Authors**: Franklin Cardenoso , Wouter Caarls
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19355](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19355)
- **Abstract**:
> The challenge of designing effective reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant bottleneck, often requiring extensive human expertise and being time-consuming. Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability.

## 37. Generative Query Expansion with Multilingual LLMs for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval
- **Authors**: Olivia Macmillan-Scott , Roksana Goworek , Eda B. Özyiğit
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19325](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19325)
- **Abstract**:
> Query expansion is the reformulation of a user query by adding semantically related information, and is an essential component of monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval used to ensure that relevant documents are not missed. Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources.

## 38. What Drives Cross-lingual Ranking? Retrieval Approaches with Multilingual Language Models
- **Authors**: Roksana Goworek , Olivia Macmillan-Scott , Eda B. Özyiğit
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19324](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19324)
- **Abstract**:
> Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) enables access to multilingual knowledge but remains challenging due to disparities in resources, scripts, and weak cross-lingual semantic alignment in embedding models. Existing pipelines often rely on translation and monolingual retrieval heuristics, which add computational overhead and noise, degrading performance. This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs. These findings indicate that cross-lingual search systems should prioritise semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning-based alignment over translation-based pipelines, particularly for cross-script and under-resourced languages.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19299)
- **Abstract**:
> Novel deep learning architectures are increasingly being applied to biological data, including genetic sequences. These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs.

- **Authors**: Lucas Li , Jean-Baptiste Puel , Florence Carton , Dounya Barrit , Jhony H. Giraldo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19263](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19263)
- **Abstract**:
> Perovskite solar cells are promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model). Solar-GECO demonstrates that integrating geometric and textual information provides a more powerful and accurate framework for PCE prediction.

- **Abstract**:
> Hunger and satiety dynamics shape dietary behaviors and metabolic health, yet remain difficult to capture in everyday settings. We present a Nutrition Photoplethysmography Language Model (NPLM), integrating continuous photoplethysmography (PPG) from wearables with meal descriptions. NPLM projects PPG into embeddings interpretable by language models, enabling joint reasoning over physiology and meal context. Trained on 19,340 participants and 1.1 million meal-PPG pairs, the model improved daily caloric intake prediction by 11% over text-only baselines, with accuracy maintained when 80% of meal text was removed. In an independent validation study (n=140) with controlled dining and detailed meal information, the model replicated these findings. These results demonstrate the value of integrating physiological measurements from consumer wearables with meal information for noninvasive dietary monitoring at scale.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19257](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19257)
- **Abstract**:
> With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

## 43. MAESTRO: Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization
- **Authors**: Boyuan Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19253](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19253)
- **Abstract**:
> Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline. These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training.

- **Abstract**:
> How and where does a transformer notice that a sentence has gone semantically off the rails? To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence.

- **Abstract**:
> Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.

- **Authors**: Xurui Li , Kaisong Song , Rui Zhu , Pin-Yu Chen , Haixu Tang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19218](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19218)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in web services, delivering unprecedented capabilities while amplifying societal risks. Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attack and defense approaches, and provides a feasible pathway for developing LLMs that can sustainably support responsible AI ecosystems.

## 47. LLM-Based Agentic Negotiation for 6G: Addressing Uncertainty Neglect and Tail-Event Risk
- **Authors**: Hatim Chergui , Farhad Rezazadeh , Mehdi Bennis , Merouane Debbah
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19175](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19175)
- **Abstract**:
> A critical barrier to the trustworthiness of sixth-generation (6G) agentic autonomous networks is the uncertainty neglect bias; a cognitive tendency for large language model (LLM)-powered agents to make high-stakes decisions based on simple averages while ignoring the tail risk of extreme events. This paper proposes an unbiased, risk-aware framework for agentic negotiation, designed to ensure robust resource allocation in 6G network slicing. Specifically, agents leverage Digital Twins (DTs) to predict full latency distributions, which are then evaluated using a formal framework from extreme value theory, namely, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This approach fundamentally shifts the agent's objective from reasoning over the mean to reasoning over the tail, thereby building a statistically-grounded buffer against worst-case outcomes. Furthermore, our framework ensures full uncertainty awareness by requiring agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty -- confidence in their own DTs predictions -- and propagate this meta-verification to make robust decisions, preventing them from acting on unreliable data. We validate this framework in a 6G inter-slice negotiation use-case between an eMBB and a URLLC agent. The results demonstrate the profound failure of the biased, mean-based baseline, which consistently fails its SLAs with a 25\% rate. Our unbiased, CVaR-aware agent successfully mitigates this bias, eliminating SLA violations and reducing the URLLC and eMBB p99.999 latencies by around 11\%. We show this reliability comes at the rational and quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17\%, exposing the false economy of the biased approach. This work provides a concrete methodology for building the trustworthy autonomous systems required for 6G.

## 48. From Pixels to Posts: Retrieval-Augmented Fashion Captioning and Hashtag Generation
- **Authors**: Moazzam Umer Gondal , Hamad Ul Qudous , Daniya Siddiqui , Asma Ahmad Farhan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19149](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19149)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented framework for automatic fashion caption and hashtag generation, combining multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting. The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.

## 49. GraphMind: Theorem Selection and Conclusion Generation Framework with Dynamic GNN for LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Yutong Li , Yitian Zhou , Xudong Wang , GuoChen , Caiyan Qin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19078](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19078)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, including multi-step reasoning such as mathematical proving. However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

## 50. Large Language Model-Assisted Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure with Real-World Case Study
- **Authors**: Xinda Zheng , Canchen Jiang , Hao Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19055](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19055)
- **Abstract**:
> The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.

- **Abstract**:
> Medical image segmentation is fundamental for biomedical discovery. Existing methods lack generalizability and demand extensive, time-consuming manual annotation for new clinical application. Here, we propose MedSAM-3, a text promptable medical segmentation model for medical image and video segmentation. By fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 architecture on medical images paired with semantic conceptual labels, our MedSAM-3 enables medical Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS), allowing precise targeting of anatomical structures via open-vocabulary text descriptions rather than solely geometric prompts. We further introduce the MedSAM-3 Agent, a framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning and iterative refinement in an agent-in-the-loop workflow. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound, CT, and video, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing specialist and foundation models. We will release our code and model at this https URL .

## 52. OrdMoE: Preference Alignment via Hierarchical Expert Group Ranking in Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs
- **Authors**: Yuting Gao , Weihao Chen , Lan Wang , Ruihan Xu , Qingpei Guo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19023)
- **Abstract**:
> Preference learning has recently emerged as a pivotal strategy for post-training alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data.

- **Authors**: Xin Yuan , Siqi Li , Jiateng Wei , Chengrui Zhu , Yanming Wu , Qingpeng Li , Jiajun Lv , Xiaoke Lan , Jun Chen , Yong Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18977](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18977)
- **Abstract**:
> Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge. While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.

## 54. SWAN: Sparse Winnowed Attention for Reduced Inference Memory via Decompression-Free KV-Cache Compression
- **Authors**: Santhosh G S , Saurav Prakash , Balaraman Ravindran
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18936)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant bottleneck during autoregressive inference due to the massive memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts.

- **Authors**: Yuchen Ji , Bo Xu , Jie Shi , Jiaqing Liang , Deqing Yang , Yu Mao , Hai Chen , Yanghua Xiao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18934](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18934)
- **Abstract**:
> The task of translating natural language questions into query languages has long been a central focus in semantic parsing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in this field. However, existing studies typically focus on a single query language, resulting in methods with limited generalizability across different languages. In this paper, we formally define the Text-to-Query task paradigm, unifying semantic parsing tasks across various query languages. We identify query skeletons as a shared optimization target of Text-to-Query tasks, and propose a general dynamic data augmentation framework that explicitly diagnoses model-specific weaknesses in handling these skeletons to synthesize targeted training data. Experiments on four Text-to-Query benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a small amount of synthesized data, highlighting the efficiency and generality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for unified research on Text-to-Query tasks. We release our code at this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18933](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18933)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

## 57. Look It Up: Analysing Internal Web Search Capabilities of Modern LLMs
- **Authors**: Sahil Kale
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18931](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18931)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern large language models integrate web search to provide real-time answers, yet it remains unclear whether they are efficiently calibrated to use search when it is actually needed. We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform. Taken together, internal web search works better as a good low-latency verification layer than a reliable analytical tool, with clear room for improvement.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18924](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18924)
- **Abstract**:
> Linux kernel evolution breaks drivers through API/ABI changes, semantic shifts, and security-hardening updates. We introduce DRIVEBENCH, an executable corpus of kernel$\rightarrow$driver co-evolution cases, and AUTODRIVER, a closed-loop, LLM-driven system for automating driver maintenance. The system integrates prompt engineering, multi-agent collaboration, static analysis, and iterative validation to ensure that generated patches are not only syntactically correct but also functionally and semantically consistent with kernel conventions. The corpus spans v5.10-v6.10 with 235 validated cases drawn from 612 candidates. In evaluation across 55 cases, AUTODRIVER achieves 56.4% compilation success; QEMU-based boot verification indicates that compiled patches preserve driver initialization in most instances. By releasing DRIVEBENCH and tooling, we enable reproducible research and a practical route to continuous, safe co-evolution of drivers with the Linux kernel.

## 59. How Learning Rate Decay Wastes Your Best Data in Curriculum-Based LLM Pretraining
- **Authors**: Kairong Luo , Zhenbo Sun , Haodong Wen , Xinyu Shi , Jiarui Cui , Chenyi Dang , Kaifeng Lyu , Wenguang Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18903](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18903)
- **Abstract**:
> Due to the scarcity of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) are often trained on mixtures of data with varying quality levels, even after sophisticated data curation. A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18890](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18890)
- **Abstract**:
> Efficient deployment of small language models (SLMs) is essential for numerous real-world applications with stringent latency constraints. While previous work on SLM design has primarily focused on reducing the number of parameters to achieve parameter-optimal SLMs, parameter efficiency does not necessarily translate into proportional real-device speed-ups. This work aims to identify the key determinants of SLMs' real-device latency and offer generalizable principles and methodologies for SLM design and training when real-device latency is the primary consideration. Specifically, we identify two central architectural factors: depth-width ratios and operator choices. The former is crucial for small-batch-size latency, while the latter affects both latency and large-batch-size throughput. In light of this, we first study latency-optimal depth-width ratios, with the key finding that although deep-thin models generally achieve better accuracy under the same parameter budget, they may not lie on the accuracy-latency trade-off frontier. Next, we explore emerging efficient attention alternatives to evaluate their potential as candidate building operators. Using the identified promising operators, we construct an evolutionary search framework to automatically discover latency-optimal combinations of these operators within hybrid SLMs, thereby advancing the accuracy-latency frontier. In addition to architectural improvements, we further enhance SLM training using a weight normalization technique that enables more effective weight updates and improves final convergence. Combining these methods, we introduce a new family of hybrid SLMs, called Nemotron-Flash, which significantly advances the accuracy-efficiency frontier of state-of-the-art SLMs, e.g., achieving over +5.5% average accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x lower latency, and 18.7x/45.6x higher throughput compared to Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B, respectively.

## 61. CoreEval: Automatically Building Contamination-Resilient Datasets with Real-World Knowledge toward Reliable LLM Evaluation
- **Authors**: Jingqian Zhao , Bingbing Wang , Geng Tu , Yice Zhang , Qianlong Wang , Bin Liang , Jing Li , Ruifeng Xu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18889](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18889)
- **Abstract**:
> Data contamination poses a significant challenge to the fairness of LLM evaluations in natural language processing tasks by inadvertently exposing models to test data during training. Current studies attempt to mitigate this issue by modifying existing datasets or generating new ones from freshly collected information. However, these methods fall short of ensuring contamination-resilient evaluation, as they fail to fully eliminate pre-existing knowledge from models or preserve the semantic complexity of the original datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoreEval}, a \textbf{Co}ntamination-\textbf{re}silient \textbf{Eval}uation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant, up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced task relevance. Ultimately, a robust data reflection mechanism is employed to iteratively verify and refine labels, ensuring consistency between the updated and original datasets. Extensive experiments on updated datasets validate the robustness of CoreEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating performance overestimation caused by data contamination.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18868](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18868)
- **Abstract**:
> High quality kernels are critical for reducing training and inference costs of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they traditionally require significant expertise in hardware architecture and software optimization. While recent advances in LLM-based code generation show promise for complex optimization, existing methods struggle with the vast optimization space due to insufficient hardware domain knowledge, failing to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We present KernelBand, a novel framework that formulates kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, enabling LLM agents to strategically navigate the optimization space by treating kernel selection and optimization strategy application as sequential decision-making processes. Our approach leverages hardware profiling information to identify promising optimization strategies and employs runtime behavior clustering to reduce exploration overhead across kernel candidates. Extensive experiments on TritonBench demonstrate that KernelBand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance with fewer tokens while exhibiting consistent improvement without saturation as computational resources increase.

## 63. Generating Reading Comprehension Exercises with Large Language Models for Educational Applications
- **Authors**: Xingyu Huang , Fei Jiang , Jianli Xiao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18860](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18860)
- **Abstract**:
> With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the applications of LLMs have grown substantially. In the education domain, LLMs demonstrate significant potential, particularly in automatic text generation, which enables the creation of intelligent and adaptive learning content. This paper proposes a new LLMs framework, which is named as Reading Comprehension Exercise Generation (RCEG). It can generate high-quality and personalized English reading comprehension exercises automatically. Firstly, RCEG uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate content candidates. Then, it uses a discriminator to select the best candidate. Finally, the quality of the generated content has been improved greatly. To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results. These metrics include content diversity, factual accuracy, linguistic toxicity, and pedagogical alignment. Experimental results show that RCEG significantly improves the relevance and cognitive appropriateness of the generated exercises.

## 64. Time Travel: LLM-Assisted Semantic Behavior Localization with Git Bisect
- **Authors**: Yujing Wang , Weize Hong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18854](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18854)
- **Abstract**:
> We present a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into the Git bisect process for semantic fault localization. Traditional bisect assumes deterministic predicates and binary failure states assumptions often violated in modern software development due to flaky tests, nonmonotonic regressions, and semantic divergence from upstream repositories. Our system augments bisect traversal with structured chain of thought reasoning, enabling commit by commit analysis under noisy conditions. We evaluate multiple open source and proprietary LLMs for their suitability and fine tune DeepSeekCoderV2 using QLoRA on a curated dataset of semantically labeled diffs. We adopt a weak supervision workflow to reduce annotation overhead, incorporating human in the loop corrections and self consistency filtering. Experiments across multiple open source projects show a 6.4 point absolute gain in success rate from 74.2 to 80.6 percent, leading to significantly fewer failed traversals and by experiment up to 2x reduction in average bisect time. We conclude with discussions on temporal reasoning, prompt design, and finetuning strategies tailored for commit level behavior analysis.

## 65. Pre-Filtering Code Suggestions using Developer Behavioral Telemetry to Optimize LLM-Assisted Programming
- **Authors**: Mohammad Nour Al Awad , Sergey Ivanov , Olga Tikhonova
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18849](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18849)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into code editors to provide AI-powered code suggestions. Yet many of these suggestions are ignored, resulting in wasted computation, increased latency, and unnecessary interruptions. We introduce a lightweight pre-filtering model that predicts the likelihood of suggestion acceptance before invoking the LLM, using only real-time developer telemetry such as typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity. Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls. These findings demonstrate that behavioral signals alone can meaningfully improve both user experience and system efficiency in LLM-assisted programming, highlighting the value of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptation mechanisms. The filter operates solely on pre-invocation editor telemetry and never inspects code or prompts.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18842](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18842)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code auto-completion by generating context-aware suggestions. Yet, deciding when to present these suggestions remains underexplored, often leading to interruptions or wasted inference calls. We propose an adaptive timing mechanism that dynamically adjusts the delay before offering a suggestion based on real-time developer feedback. Our suggested method combines a logistic transform of recent acceptance rates with a bounded delay range, anchored by a high-level binary prediction of the developer's cognitive state. In a two-month deployment with professional developers, our system improved suggestion acceptance from 4.9% with no delay to 15.4% with static delays, and to 18.6% with adaptive timing-while reducing blind rejections (rejections without being read) from 8.3% to 0.36%. Together, these improvements increase acceptance and substantially reduce wasted inference calls by 75%, making LLM-based code assistants more efficient and cost-effective in practice.

## 67. Solving a Research Problem in Mathematical Statistics with AI Assistance
- **Authors**: Edgar Dobriban
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18828](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18828)
- **Abstract**:
> Over the last few months, AI models including large language models have improved greatly. There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded this http URL a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arXiv:2308.01853v2 ), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp. Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.

## 68. HyperbolicRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hyperbolic Representations
- **Authors**: Cao Linxiao , Wang Ruitao , Li Jindong , Zhou Zhipeng , Yang Menglin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18808](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18808)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge, helping mitigate hallucinations and enhance domain-specific expertise. Graph-based RAG enhances structural reasoning by introducing explicit relational organization that enables information propagation across semantically connected text units. However, these methods typically rely on Euclidean embeddings that capture semantic similarity but lack a geometric notion of hierarchical depth, limiting their ability to represent abstraction relationships inherent in complex knowledge graphs. To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG. HyperbolicRAG introduces three key designs: (1) a depth-aware representation learner that embeds nodes within a shared Poincare manifold to align semantic similarity with hierarchical containment, (2) an unsupervised contrastive regularization that enforces geometric consistency across abstraction levels, and (3) a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism that jointly exploits retrieval signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, emphasizing cross-space agreement during inference. Extensive experiments across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that HyperbolicRAG outperforms competitive baselines, including both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines.

## 69. Any4D: Open-Prompt 4D Generation from Natural Language and Images
- **Authors**: Hao Li , Qiao Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18746)
- **Abstract**:
> While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a \textit{"GPT moment"} in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: \textit{the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions}. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{Primitive Embodied World Models} (PEWM), which restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons, our approach \textit{1) enables} fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, \textit{2) reduces} learning complexity, \textit{3) improves} data efficiency in embodied data collection, and \textit{4) decreases} inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

- **Authors**: Yu Lei , Shuzheng Si , Wei Wang , Yifei Wu , Gang Chen , Fanchao Qi , Maosong Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18743](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18743)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models are evolving from single-turn responders into tool-using agents capable of sustained reasoning and decision-making for deep research. Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrate that RhinoInsight achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep research tasks while remaining competitive on deep search tasks.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18735](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18735)
- **Abstract**:
> In this work, we define Foresight Intelligence as the capability to anticipate and interpret future events-an ability essential for applications such as autonomous driving, yet largely overlooked by existing research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.

## 72. Empathetic Cascading Networks: A Multi-Stage Prompting Technique for Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Wangjiaxuan Xin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18696](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18696)
- **Abstract**:
> This report presents the Empathetic Cascading Networks (ECN) framework, a multi-stage prompting method designed to enhance the empathetic and inclusive capabilities of large language models. ECN employs four stages: Perspective Adoption, Emotional Resonance, Reflective Understanding, and Integrative Synthesis, to guide models toward generating emotionally resonant and contextually aware responses. Experimental results demonstrate that ECN achieves the highest Empathy Quotient (EQ) scores across GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, while maintaining competitive Regard and Perplexity metrics. These findings emphasize ECN's potential for applications requiring empathy and inclusivity in conversational AI.

## 73. VLM in a flash: I/O-Efficient Sparsification of Vision-Language Model via Neuron Chunking
- **Authors**: Kichang Yang , Seonjun Kim , Minjae Kim , Nairan Zhang , Chi Zhang , Youngki Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18692](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18692)
- **Abstract**:
> Edge deployment of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly relies on flash-based weight offloading, where activation sparsification is used to reduce I/O overhead. However, conventional sparsification remains model-centric, selecting neurons solely by activation magnitude and neglecting how access patterns influence flash performance. We present Neuron Chunking, an I/O-efficient sparsification strategy that operates on chunks (i.e., groups of contiguous neurons in memory) and couples neuron importance with storage access cost. The method models I/O latency through a lightweight abstraction of access contiguity and selects chunks with high utility, defined as neuron importance normalized by estimated latency. By aligning sparsification decisions with the underlying storage behavior, Neuron Chunking improves I/O efficiency by up to 4.65x and 5.76x on Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, respectively.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18676](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18676)
- **Abstract**:
> Current vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine are primarily designed for categorical question answering (e.g., "Is this normal or abnormal?") or qualitative descriptive tasks. However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging. Code and data are available at this https URL .

## 75. FHE-Agent: Automating CKKS Configuration for Practical Encrypted Inference via an LLM-Guided Agentic Framework
- **Authors**: Nuo Xu , Zhaoting Gong , Ran Ran , Jinwei Tang , Wujie Wen , Caiwen Ding
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18653](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18653)
- **Abstract**:
> Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), particularly the CKKS scheme, is a promising enabler for privacy-preserving MLaaS, but its practical deployment faces a prohibitive barrier: it heavily relies on domain expertise. Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These "one-shot" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks. We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates. We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than naïve search strategies. Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup.

## 76. Kitty: Accurate and Efficient 2-bit KV Cache Quantization with Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18643](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18643)
- **Abstract**:
> The KV cache is a dominant memory bottleneck for LLM inference. While 4-bit KV quantization preserves accuracy, 2-bit often degrades it, especially on long-context reasoning. We close this gap via an algorithm-system co-design for mixed-precision KV caching: Kitty. On the algorithm side, extensive experiments show that Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost -- which ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity and keeps only a small fraction at higher precision -- maintains near-zero loss in accuracy drop while approaching 2-bit memory. The main challenge is handling dynamic 4-bit channel boosts while keeping the page layout coalesced and the dequantization uniform, with no scattered reads or hard-coded masks. Kitty addresses these issues by decompose each mixed-precision Key page into two tensors with unified 2-bit precision. Based on this, Kitty provides a page-centric KV layout, Triton-compatible page dequantization kernels, and a lightweight runtime pipeline that preserves coalescing and avoids divergence. Across seven tasks and two model families (Qwen3, LLaMA3), Kitty cuts KV memory by nearly 8x with negligible accuracy loss, enabling up to 8x larger batches and 2.1x-4.1x higher throughput under the same memory budget. We release the full implementation of Kitty at this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18640](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18640)
- **Abstract**:
> Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.

## 78. No Free Lunch in Language Model Bias Mitigation? Targeted Bias Reduction Can Exacerbate Unmitigated LLM Biases
- **Authors**: Shireen Chand , Faith Baca , Emilio Ferrara
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18635](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18635)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit societal biases from their training data, potentially leading to harmful or unfair outputs. While various techniques aim to mitigate these biases, their effects are often evaluated only along the dimension of the bias being targeted. This work investigates the cross-category consequences of targeted bias mitigation. We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence. These findings underscore the critical need for robust, multi-dimensional evaluation tools when examining and developing bias mitigation strategies to avoid inadvertently shifting or worsening bias along untargeted axes.

## 79. Majority of the Bests: Improving Best-of-N via Bootstrapping
- **Authors**: Amin Rakhsha , Kanika Madan , Tianyu Zhang , Amir-massoud Farahmand , Amir Khasahmadi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18630](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18630)
- **Abstract**:
> Sampling multiple outputs from a Large Language Model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent (Self-consistency) or highest-scoring (Best-of-N) candidate is a popular approach to achieve higher accuracy in tasks with discrete final answers. Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping. MoB serves as a simple, yet strong alternative to BoN and self-consistency, and more broadly, motivates further research in more nuanced selection mechanisms.

## 80. OpenGloss: A Synthetic Encyclopedic Dictionary and Semantic Knowledge Graph
- **Authors**: Michael J. Bommarito II
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18622](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18622)
- **Abstract**:
> We present OpenGloss, a synthetic encyclopedic dictionary and semantic knowledge graph for English that integrates lexicographic definitions, encyclopedic context, etymological histories, and semantic relationships in a unified resource. OpenGloss contains 537K senses across 150K lexemes, on par with WordNet 3.1 and Open English WordNet, while providing more than four times as many sense definitions. These lexemes include 9.1M semantic edges, 1M usage examples, 3M collocations, and 60M words of encyclopedic content. Generated through a multi-agent procedural generation pipeline with schema-validated LLM outputs and automated quality assurance, the entire resource was produced in under one week for under $1,000. This demonstrates that structured generation can create comprehensive lexical resources at cost and time scales impractical for manual curation, enabling rapid iteration as foundation models improve. The resource addresses gaps in pedagogical applications by providing integrated content -- definitions, examples, collocations, encyclopedias, etymology -- that supports both vocabulary learning and natural language processing tasks. As a synthetically generated resource, OpenGloss reflects both the capabilities and limitations of current foundation models. The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face under CC-BY 4.0, enabling researchers and educators to build upon and adapt this resource.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18589](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18589)
- **Abstract**:
> Organizations are rapidly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform their operations, yet they lack clear guidance on key decisions for adoption and implementation. While LLMs offer powerful capabilities in content generation, assisted coding, and process automation, businesses face critical challenges in data security, LLM solution development approach, infrastructure requirements, and deployment strategies. Healthcare providers must protect patient data while leveraging LLMs for medical analysis, financial institutions need to balance automated customer service with regulatory compliance, and software companies seek to enhance development productivity while maintaining code security. This article presents a systematic six-step decision framework for LLM adoption, helping organizations navigate from initial application selection to final deployment. Based on extensive interviews and analysis of successful and failed implementations, our framework provides practical guidance for business leaders to align technological capabilities with business objectives. Through key decision points and real-world examples from both B2B and B2C contexts, organizations can make informed decisions about LLM adoption while ensuring secure and efficient integration across various use cases, from customer service automation to content creation and advanced analytics.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18578](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18578)
- **Abstract**:
> Financial time series forecasting is central to trading, portfolio optimization, and risk management, yet it remains challenging due to noisy, non-stationary, and heterogeneous data. Recent advances in time series foundation models (TSFMs), inspired by large language models, offer a new paradigm for learning generalizable temporal representations from large and diverse datasets. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation. Increasing the dataset size, incorporating synthetic data augmentation, and applying hyperparameter tuning further enhance performance.

- **Authors**: Kai Jiang , Siqi Huang , Xiangyu Chen , Jiawei Shao , Hongyuan Zhang , Xuelong Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18507](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18507)
- **Abstract**:
> Continual learning in visual understanding aims to deal with catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.

## 84. MindEval: Benchmarking Language Models on Multi-turn Mental Health Support
- **Authors**: José Pombal , Maya D'Eon , Nuno M. Guerreiro , Pedro Henrique Martins , António Farinhas , Ricardo Rei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18491](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18491)
- **Abstract**:
> Demand for mental health support through AI chatbots is surging, though current systems present several limitations, like sycophancy or overvalidation, and reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs. A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions. Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation. To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design. We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments. Then, we evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs and show that all models struggle, scoring below 4 out of 6, on average, with particular weaknesses in problematic AI-specific patterns of communication. Notably, reasoning capabilities and model scale do not guarantee better performance, and systems deteriorate with longer interactions or when supporting patients with severe symptoms. We release all code, prompts, and human evaluation data.

## 85. Evaluating perturbation robustnessof generative systems that use COBOL code inputs
- **Authors**: Samuel Ackerman , Wesam Ibraheem , Orna Raz , Marcel Zalmanovici
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18488](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18488)
- **Abstract**:
> Systems incorporating large language models (LLMs) as a component are known to be sensitive (i.e., non-robust) to minor input variations that do not change the meaning of the input; such sensitivity may reduce the system's usefulness. Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation. These tools can be further used to improve the system by, for instance, indicating variations that should be handled by pre-processing steps.

## 86. Shadows in the Code: Exploring the Risks and Defenses of LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Development Systems
- **Authors**: Xiaoqing Wang , Keman Huang , Bin Liang , Hongyu Li , Xiaoyong Du
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18467](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18467)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems has significantly streamlined software developing tasks, enabling users with little technical expertise to develop executable applications. While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.

## 87. DocPTBench: Benchmarking End-to-End Photographed Document Parsing and Translation
- **Authors**: Yongkun Du , Pinxuan Chen , Xuye Ying , Zhineng Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18434](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18434)
- **Abstract**:
> The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for end-to-end document parsing and translation. However, prevailing benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and DITrans are dominated by pristine scanned or digital-born documents, and thus fail to adequately represent the intricate challenges of real-world capture conditions, such as geometric distortions and photometric variations. To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models. Dataset and code are available at this https URL .

## 88. General Agentic Memory Via Deep Research
- **Authors**: B.Y. Yan , Chaofan Li , Hongjin Qian , Shuqi Lu , Zheng Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18423](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18423)
- **Abstract**:
> Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of "\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.

- **Authors**: Dana Arad , Yonatan Belinkov , Hanjie Chen , Najoung Kim , Hosein Mohebbi , Aaron Mueller , Gabriele Sarti , Martin Tutek
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18409](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18409)
- **Abstract**:
> Mechanistic interpretability (MI) seeks to uncover how language models (LMs) implement specific behaviors, yet measuring progress in MI remains challenging. The recently released Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB; Mueller et al., 2025) provides a standardized framework for evaluating circuit and causal variable localization. Building on this foundation, the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task extends MIB into a community-wide reproducible comparison of MI techniques. The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features. With three teams spanning eight different methods, participants achieved notable gains in circuit localization using ensemble and regularization strategies for circuit discovery. With one team spanning two methods, participants achieved significant gains in causal variable localization using low-dimensional and non-linear projections to featurize activation vectors. The MIB leaderboard remains open; we encourage continued work in this standard evaluation framework to measure progress in MI research going forward.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18335](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18335)
- **Abstract**:
> The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structured outputs that follow arbitrary schemas is crucial to a wide range of downstream tasks that require diverse structured representations of results such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. While modern LLMs excel in generating unstructured responses in natural language, whether this advancement translates to a strong performance on text-to-structure tasks remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first introduce OmniStruct, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities on diverse text-to-structure tasks such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. We build OmniStruct by identifying existing datasets across a wide range of tasks that are suitable for a structured answer format, and adapting them under a unified text-to-structure problem setting. To facilitate the development of efficient text-to-structure models, we collect high-quality training data via synthetic task generation. Without using any supervised data for OmniStruct tasks, our experiments demonstrate the possibility of fine-tuning much smaller models on synthetic data into universal structured generation models that can rival the performance of GPT-4o.

## 91. AnyExperts: On-Demand Expert Allocation for Multimodal Language Models with Mixture of Expert
- **Authors**: Yuting Gao , Wang Lan , Hengyuan Zhao , Linjiang Huang , Si Liu , Qingpei Guo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18314](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18314)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer a promising path toward scalable and efficient large vision-language systems. However, existing approaches rely on rigid routing strategies (typically activating a fixed number of experts per token) ignoring the inherent heterogeneity in semantic importance across modalities. This leads to suboptimal compute allocation, where redundant tokens consume as many resources as critical ones. To address this, we propose AnyExperts, a novel on-demand, budget-aware dynamic routing framework that allocates a variable total number of expert slots per token based on its semantic importance. Crucially, to prevent uncontrolled compute growth, the total slots per token are constrained within a fixed range, and each slot is filled by either a real expert or a virtual expert, with the virtual share capped at a small maximum (e.g., 20%). The model then adaptively balances the real-to-virtual ratio per token, assigning more real experts to semantically rich regions and relying more on virtual experts for redundant content. Evaluated across diverse tasks in visual understanding, audio understanding, and NLP understanding, AnyExperts improves performance under the same compute budget. Notably, on general image/video tasks, it achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer real expert activations; on text-dense tasks (OCR and NLP), it maintains performance while reducing real expert usage by 10%. These results demonstrate that fine-grained, importance-driven expert allocation significantly enhances both the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal MoE models.

Seshia
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18274](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18274)
- **Abstract**:
> Digital health interventions are increasingly used in physical and occupational therapy to deliver home exercise programs via sensor equipped devices such as smartphones, enabling remote monitoring of adherence and performance. However, digital interventions are typically programmed as software before clinical encounters as libraries of parametrized exercise modules targeting broad patient populations. At the point of care, clinicians can only select modules and adjust a narrow set of parameters like repetitions, so patient specific needs that emerge during encounters, such as distinct movement limitations, and home environments, are rarely reflected in the software. We evaluated a digital intervention paradigm that uses large language models (LLMs) to translate clinicians' exercise prescriptions into intervention software. In a prospective single arm feasibility study with 20 licensed physical and occupational therapists and a standardized patient, clinicians created 40 individualized upper extremity programs (398 instructions) that were automatically translated into executable software. Our results show a 45% increase in the proportion of personalized prescriptions that can be implemented as software compared with a template based benchmark, with unanimous consensus among therapists on ease of use. The LLM generated software correctly delivered 99.78% (397/398) of instructions as prescribed and monitored performance with 88.4% (352/398) accuracy, with 90% (18/20) of therapists judged it safe to interact with patients, and 75% (15/20) expressed willingness to adopt it. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective evaluation of clinician directed intervention software generation with LLMs in healthcare, demonstrating feasibility and motivating larger trials to assess clinical effectiveness and safety in real patient populations.

## 93. LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation
- **Authors**: Shijun Li , Yu Wang , Jin Wang , Ying Li , Joydeep Ghosh , Anne Cocos
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.

## 94. Hybrid Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems in Smart Manufacturing
- **Authors**: Mojtaba A. Farahani , Md Irfan Khan , Thorsten Wuest
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18258](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18258)
- **Abstract**:
> The convergence of Agentic AI and MAS enables a new paradigm for intelligent decision making in SMS. Traditional MAS architectures emphasize distributed coordination and specialized autonomy, while recent advances in agentic AI driven by LLMs introduce higher order reasoning, planning, and tool orchestration capabilities. This paper presents a hybrid agentic AI and multi agent framework for a Prescriptive Maintenance use case, where LLM based agents provide strategic orchestration and adaptive reasoning, complemented by rule based and SLMs agents performing efficient, domain specific tasks on the edge. The proposed framework adopts a layered architecture that consists of perception, preprocessing, analytics, and optimization layers, coordinated through an LLM Planner Agent that manages workflow decisions and context retention. Specialized agents autonomously handle schema discovery, intelligent feature analysis, model selection, and prescriptive optimization, while a HITL interface ensures transparency and auditability of generated maintenance recommendations. This hybrid design supports dynamic model adaptation, cost efficient maintenance scheduling, and interpretable decision making. An initial proof of concept implementation is validated on two industrial manufacturing datasets. The developed framework is modular and extensible, supporting seamless integration of new agents or domain modules as capabilities evolve. The results demonstrate the system capability to automatically detect schema, adapt preprocessing pipelines, optimize model performance through adaptive intelligence, and generate actionable, prioritized maintenance recommendations. The framework shows promise in achieving improved robustness, scalability, and explainability for RxM in smart manufacturing, bridging the gap between high level agentic reasoning and low level autonomous execution.

## 95. Can LLMs Help Allocate Public Health Resources? A Case Study on Childhood Lead Testing
- **Authors**: Mohamed Afane , Ying Wang , Juntao Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18239](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18239)
- **Abstract**:
> Public health agencies face critical challenges in identifying high-risk neighborhoods for childhood lead exposure with limited resources for outreach and intervention programs. To address this, we develop a Priority Score integrating untested children proportions, elevated blood lead prevalence, and public health coverage patterns to support optimized resource allocation decisions across 136 neighborhoods in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. We leverage these allocation tasks, which require integrating multiple vulnerability indicators and interpreting empirical evidence, to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning and deep research capabilities can effectively allocate public health resources when presented with structured allocation scenarios. LLMs were tasked with distributing 1,000 test kits within each city based on neighborhood vulnerability indicators. Results reveal significant limitations: LLMs frequently overlooked neighborhoods with highest lead prevalence and largest proportions of untested children, such as West Englewood in Chicago, while allocating disproportionate resources to lower-priority areas like Hunts Point in New York City. Overall accuracy averaged 0.46, reaching a maximum of 0.66 with ChatGPT 5 Deep Research. Despite their marketed deep research capabilities, LLMs struggled with fundamental limitations in information retrieval and evidence-based reasoning, frequently citing outdated data and allowing non-empirical narratives about neighborhood conditions to override quantitative vulnerability indicators.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18221](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18221)
- **Abstract**:
> This research full paper presents an enhancement pipeline for large language models (LLMs) in assessing homework for an undergraduate circuit analysis course, aiming to improve LLMs' capacity to provide personalized support to electrical engineering students. Existing evaluations have demonstrated that GPT-4o possesses promising capabilities in assessing student homework in this domain. Building on these findings, we enhance GPT-4o's performance through multi-step prompting, contextual data augmentation, and the incorporation of targeted hints. These strategies effectively address common errors observed in GPT-4o's responses when using simple prompts, leading to a substantial improvement in assessment accuracy. Specifically, the correct response rate for GPT-4o increases from 74.71% to 97.70% after applying the enhanced prompting and augmented data on entry-level circuit analysis topics. This work lays a foundation for the effective integration of LLMs into circuit analysis instruction and, more broadly, into engineering education.

## 97. ARIAL: An Agentic Framework for Document VQA with Precise Answer Localization
- **Authors**: Ahmad Mohammadshirazi , Pinaki Prasad Guha Neogi , Dheeraj Kulshrestha , Rajiv Ramnath
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18192](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18192)
- **Abstract**:
> Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.

## 98. Towards a General Framework for HTN Modeling with LLMs
- **Authors**: Israel Puerta-Merino , Carlos Núñez-Molina , Pablo Mesejo , Juan Fernández-Olivares
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18165](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18165)
- **Abstract**:
> The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Automated Planning (AP) models has been widely explored; however, their application to Hierarchical Planning (HP) is still far from reaching the level of sophistication observed in non-hierarchical architectures. In this work, we try to address this gap. We present two main contributions. First, we propose L2HP, an extension of L2P (a library to LLM-driven PDDL models generation) that support HP model generation and follows a design philosophy of generality and extensibility. Second, we apply our framework to perform experiments where we compare the modeling capabilities of LLMs for AP and HP. On the PlanBench dataset, results show that parsing success is limited but comparable in both settings (around 36\%), while syntactic validity is substantially lower in the hierarchical case (1\% vs. 20\% of instances). These findings underscore the unique challenges HP presents for LLMs, highlighting the need for further research to improve the quality of generated HP models.

## 99. Nested Unfolding Network for Real-World Concealed Object Segmentation
- **Authors**: Chunming He , Rihan Zhang , Dingming Zhang , Fengyang Xiao , Deng-Ping Fan , Sina Farsiu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18164](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18164)
- **Abstract**:
> Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.

## 100. Bias Is a Subspace, Not a Coordinate: A Geometric Rethinking of Post-hoc Debiasing in Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Dachuan Zhao , Weiyue Li , Zhenda Shen , Yushu Qiu , Bowen Xu , Haoyu Chen , Yongchao Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18123](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18123)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.

- **Authors**: Ming Zhong , Yuanlei Wang , Liuzhou Zhang , Arctanx An , Renrui Zhang , Hao Liang , Ming Lu , Ying Shen , Wentao Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18121](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18121)
- **Abstract**:
> While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmarks, their processing paradigm differs from the human ability to integrate visual information. Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

## 102. The Alignment Paradox of Medical Large Language Models in Infertility Care: Decoupling Algorithmic Improvement from Clinical Decision-making Quality
- **Authors**: Dou Liu , Ying Long , Sophia Zuoqiu , Kaipeng Xie , Runze Yang , Di Liu , Kang Li , Yiting Lin , Hanyi Liu , Rong Yin , Tian Tang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18084](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18084)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet aligning them with the multifaceted reasoning pathways of real-world medicine remains a major challenge. Using more than 8,000 infertility treatment records, we systematically evaluate four alignment strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) through a dual-layer framework combining automatic benchmarks with blinded doctor-in-the-loop assessments. GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks. However, clinicians consistently prefer the SFT model, citing clearer reasoning processes (p = 0.035) and higher therapeutic feasibility (p = 0.019). In blinded pairwise comparisons, SFT attains the highest winning rate (51.2%), outperforming both GRPO (26.2%) and even physicians' original decisions (22.7%). These results reveal an alignment paradox: algorithmic improvements do not necessarily translate into higher clinical trust, and may diverge from human-centered preferences. Our findings highlight the need for alignment strategies that prioritize clinically interpretable and practically feasible reasoning, rather than solely optimizing decision-level accuracy.

## 103. MASTEST: A LLM-Based Multi-Agent System For RESTful API Tests
- **Authors**: Xiaoke Han , Hong Zhu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18038](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18038)
- **Abstract**:
> Testing RESTful API is increasingly important in quality assurance of cloud-native applications. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance. DeepSeek excels in data type correctness and status code detection, while GPT-4o performs best in API operation coverage. For both models, LLM generated test scripts maintained 100\% syntax correctness and only required minimal manual edits for semantic correctness. These findings indicate the effectiveness and feasibility of MASTEST.

## 104. Extracting Interaction-Aware Monosemantic Concepts in Recommender Systems
- **Authors**: Dor Arviv , Yehonatan Elisha , Oren Barkan , Noam Koenigstein
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18024)
- **Abstract**:
> We present a method for extracting \emph{monosemantic} neurons, defined as latent dimensions that align with coherent and interpretable concepts, from user and item embeddings in recommender systems. Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17986](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17986)
- **Abstract**:
> Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis, yet they often struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured "semantic sketches" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.

## 106. Measuring the Impact of Lexical Training Data Coverage on Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Shuo Zhang , Fabrizio Gotti , Fengran Mo , Jian-Yun Nie
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17946](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17946)
- **Abstract**:
> Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental challenge, particularly in open-domain question answering. Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty. These findings suggest that lexical coverage features provide a complementary signal for hallucination detection. All code and suffix-array infrastructure are provided at this https URL .

## 107. PA-FAS: Towards Interpretable and Generalizable Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing via Path-Augmented Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Yingjie Ma , Xun Lin , Yong Xu , Weicheng Xie , Zitong Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17927](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17927)
- **Abstract**:
> Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has recently advanced in multimodal fusion, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.

## 108. Towards Efficient LLM-aware Heterogeneous Graph Learning
- **Authors**: Wenda Li , Tongya Zheng , Shunyu Liu , Yu Wang , Kaixuan Chen , Hanyang Yuan , Bingde Hu , Zujie Ren , Mingli Song , Gang Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17923](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17923)
- **Abstract**:
> Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at this https URL .

## 109. Principled Context Engineering for RAG: Statistical Guarantees via Conformal Prediction
- **Authors**: Debashish Chakraborty , Eugene Yang , Daniel Khashabi , Dawn Lawrie , Kevin Duh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17908](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17908)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17854](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17854)
- **Abstract**:
> The capacity for highly complex, evidence-based, and strategically adaptive persuasion remains a formidable great challenge for artificial intelligence. Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. Expert human debate coaches also prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by DeepDebater. We open source all code, generated speech transcripts, audio and talking head video here: this https URL

## 111. APRIL: Annotations for Policy evaluation with Reliable Inference from LLMs
- **Authors**: Aishwarya Mandyam , Kalyani Limaye , Barbara E. Engelhardt , Emily Alsentzer
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17818](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17818)
- **Abstract**:
> Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the value of a contextual bandit policy prior to deployment. As such, OPE plays a critical role in ensuring safety in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, standard OPE approaches are limited by the size and coverage of the behavior dataset. While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based counterfactual annotations offer a scalable approach for addressing coverage limitations in healthcare datasets, enabling safer deployment of decision-making policies in clinical settings.

## 112. Point of Order: Action-Aware LLM Persona Modeling for Realistic Civic Simulation
- **Authors**: Scott Merrill , Shashank Srivastava
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17813)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models offer opportunities to simulate multi-party deliberation, but realistic modeling remains limited by a lack of speaker-attributed data. Transcripts produced via automatic speech recognition (ASR) assign anonymous speaker labels (e.g., Speaker_1), preventing models from capturing consistent human behavior. This work introduces a reproducible pipeline to transform public Zoom recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts with metadata like persona profiles and pragmatic action tags (e.g., [propose_motion]). We release three local government deliberation datasets: Appellate Court hearings, School Board meetings, and Municipal Council sessions. Fine-tuning LLMs to model specific participants using this "action-aware" data produces a 67% reduction in perplexity and nearly doubles classifier-based performance metrics for speaker fidelity and realism. Turing-style human evaluations show our simulations are often indistinguishable from real deliberations, providing a practical and scalable method for complex realistic civic simulations.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17775](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17775)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic frameworks powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can be useful tools in scientific workflows by enabling human-AI co-creation. A key challenge is recommending the next steps during workflow creation without relying solely on LLMs, which risk hallucination and require fine-tuning with scarce proprietary data. We propose an episodic memory architecture that stores and retrieves past workflows to guide agents in suggesting plausible next tasks. By matching current workflows with historical sequences, agents can recommend steps based on prior patterns.

## 114. Understanding Counting Mechanisms in Large Language and Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Hosein Hasani , Amirmohammad Izadi , Fatemeh Askari , Mobin Bagherian , Sadegh Mohammadian , Mohammad Izadi , Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17699](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17699)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.

## 115. Liberating Logic in the Age of AI: Going Beyond Programming with Computational Thinking
- **Authors**: Douglas C. Schmidt , Dan Runfola
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17696](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17696)
- **Abstract**:
> Mastering one or more programming languages has historically been the gateway to implementing ideas on a computer. Today, that gateway is widening with advances in large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistants. What matters is no longer just fluency in traditional programming languages but the ability to think computationally by translating problems into forms that can be solved with computing tools. The capabilities enabled by these AI-augmented tools are rapidly leading to the commoditization of computational thinking, such that anyone who can articulate a problem in natural language can potentially harness computing power via AI. This shift is poised to radically influence how we teach computer science and data science in the United States and around the world. Educators and industry leaders are grappling with how to adapt: What should students learn when the hottest new programming language is English? How do we prepare a generation of computational thinkers who need not code every algorithm manually, but must still think critically, design solutions, and verify AI-augmented results? This paper explores these questions, examining the impact of natural language programming on software development, the emerging distinction between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, the reforms needed in computer science and data science curricula, and the importance of maintaining our fundamental computational science principles in an AI-augmented future. Along the way, we compare approaches and share best practices for embracing this new paradigm in computing education.

## 116. ARISE: Agentic Rubric-Guided Iterative Survey Engine for Automated Scholarly Paper Generation
- **Authors**: Zi Wang , Xingqiao Wang , Sangah Lee , Xiaowei Xu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17689](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17689)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid expansion of scholarly literature presents significant challenges in synthesizing comprehensive, high-quality academic surveys. Recent advancements in agentic systems offer considerable promise for automating tasks that traditionally require human expertise, including literature review, synthesis, and iterative refinement. However, existing automated survey-generation solutions often suffer from inadequate quality control, poor formatting, and limited adaptability to iterative feedback, which are core elements intrinsic to scholarly writing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE, an Agentic Rubric-guided Iterative Survey Engine designed for automated generation and continuous refinement of academic survey papers. ARISE employs a modular architecture composed of specialized large language model agents, each mirroring distinct scholarly roles such as topic expansion, citation curation, literature summarization, manuscript drafting, and peer-review-based evaluation. Central to ARISE is a rubric-guided iterative refinement loop in which multiple reviewer agents independently assess manuscript drafts using a structured, behaviorally anchored rubric, systematically enhancing the content through synthesized feedback. Evaluating ARISE against state-of-the-art automated systems and recent human-written surveys, our experimental results demonstrate superior performance, achieving an average rubric-aligned quality score of 92.48. ARISE consistently surpasses baseline methods across metrics of comprehensiveness, accuracy, formatting, and overall scholarly rigor. All code, evaluation rubrics, and generated outputs are provided openly at this https URL

- **Authors**: Lara Hassan , Mohamed ElZeftawy , Abdulrahman Mahmoud
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17683](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17683)
- **Abstract**:
> As the Middle East emerges as a strategic hub for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, the feasibility of deploying sustainable datacenters in desert environments has become a topic of growing relevance. This paper presents an empirical study analyzing the energy consumption and carbon footprint of large language model (LLM) inference across four countries: the United Arab Emirates, Iceland, Germany, and the United States of America using DeepSeek Coder 1.3B and the HumanEval dataset on the task of code generation. We use the CodeCarbon library to track energy and carbon emissions andcompare geographical trade-offs for climate-aware AI deployment. Our findings highlight both the challenges and potential of datacenters in desert regions and provide a balanced outlook on their role in global AI expansion.

## 118. A Cross-Cultural Assessment of Human Ability to Detect LLM-Generated Fake News about South Africa
- **Authors**: Tim Schlippe , Matthias Wölfel , Koena Ronny Mabokela
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17682)
- **Abstract**:
> This study investigates how cultural proximity affects the ability to detect AI-generated fake news by comparing South African participants with those from other nationalities. As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content. These insights contribute to understanding cross-cultural dimensions of misinformation detection and inform strategies for combating AI-generated fake news in increasingly globalised information ecosystems where content crosses cultural and geographical boundaries.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17680](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17680)
- **Abstract**:
> This work addresses the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to reduce the time required to set up electromagnetic simulation models. A chatbot based on a large language model is presented, enabling the automated generation of simulation models with various functional enhancements. A chatbot-driven workflow based on the large language model Google Gemini 2.0 Flash automatically generates and solves two-dimensional finite element eddy current models using Gmsh and GetDP. Python is used to coordinate and automate interactions between the workflow components. The study considers conductor geometries with circular cross-sections of variable position and number. Additionally, users can define custom post-processing routines and receive a concise summary of model information and simulation results.

## 120. Chatbots to strengthen democracy: An interdisciplinary seminar to train identifying argumentation techniques of science denial
- **Authors**: Ingo Siegert , Jan Nehring , Aranxa Márquez Ampudia , Matthias Busch , Stefan Hillmann
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17678](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17678)
- **Abstract**:
> In recent times, discussions on social media platforms have increasingly come under scrutiny due to the proliferation of science denial and fake news. Traditional solutions, such as regulatory actions, have been implemented to mitigate the spread of misinformation; however, these measures alone are not sufficient. To complement these efforts, educational approaches are becoming essential in empowering users to critically engage with misinformation. Conversation training, through serious games or personalized methods, has emerged as a promising strategy to help users handle science denial and toxic conversation tactics. This paper suggests an interdisciplinary seminar to explore the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as a persona of a science denier to support people in identifying misinformation and improving resilience against toxic interactions. In the seminar, groups of four to five students will develop an AI-based chatbot that enables realistic interactions with science-denial argumentation structures. The task involves planning the setting, integrating a Large Language Model to facilitate natural dialogues, implementing the chatbot using the RASA framework, and evaluating the outcomes in a user study. It is crucial that users understand what they need to do during the interaction, how to conclude it, and how the relevant information is conveyed. The seminar does not aim to develop chatbots for practicing debunking but serves to teach AI technologies and test the feasibility of this idea for future applications. The chatbot seminar is conducted as a hybrid, parallel master's module at the participating educational institutions.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17676](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17676)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid progress in Generative AI and Agent technologies is profoundly transforming enterprise data management and analytics. Traditional database applications and system deployment are fundamentally impacted by AI-driven tools, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector database technologies, which provide new pathways for semantic querying over enterprise knowledge bases. In the meantime, data security and compliance are top priorities for organizations adopting AI technologies. For enterprise data analysis, SQL generations powered by large language models (LLMs) and AI agents, has emerged as a key bridge connecting natural language with structured data, effectively lowering the barrier to enterprise data access and improving analytical efficiency. This paper focuses on enterprise data analysis applications and system deployment, covering a range of innovative frameworks, enabling complex query understanding, multi-agent collaboration, security verification, and computational efficiency. Through representative use cases, key challenges related to distributed deployment, data security, and inherent difficulties in SQL generation tasks are discussed.

## 122. MURMUR: Using cross-user chatter to break collaborative language agents in groups
- **Authors**: Atharv Singh Patlan , Peiyao Sheng , S. Ashwin Hebbar , Prateek Mittal , Pramod Viswanath
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17671](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17671)
- **Abstract**:
> Language agents are rapidly expanding from single-user assistants to multi-user collaborators in shared workspaces and groups. However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments. Finally, we introduce a first-step defense with task-based clustering to mitigate this new class of vulnerability

- **Abstract**:
> High-performance computing (HPC) and parallel computing increasingly rely on global collaboration among diverse teams, yet traditional computing curricula inadequately prepare students for cross-cultural teamwork essential in modern computational research environments. This paper presents Empa, an AI-powered virtual mentor that integrates intercultural collaboration training into undergraduate computing education. Built using large language models and deployed through a progressive web application, Empa guides students through structured activities covering cultural dimensions, communication styles, and conflict resolution that are critical for effective multicultural teamwork. Our system addresses the growing need for culturally competent HPC professionals by helping computing students develop skills to collaborate effectively in international research teams, contribute to global computational projects, and navigate the cultural complexities inherent in distributed computing environments. Pilot preparation for deployment in computing courses demonstrates the feasibility of AI-mediated intercultural training and provides insights into scalable approaches for developing intercultural collaboration skills essential for HPC workforce development.

## 124. Evaluating Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Modern Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Tom Perel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17666](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17666)
- **Abstract**:
> The recent boom and rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a wide range of applications warrants a deeper understanding of their security and safety vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms.

## 125. Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT): A Data-Free Framework for Cross-Model Understanding Transfer
- **Authors**: Pratham Sorte
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17638](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17638)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern artificial intelligence systems depend heavily on large datasets for both training and transferring knowledge between models. Knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and dataset distillation have made such transfers more efficient, yet they remain fundamentally data-driven: a teacher must produce examples, logits, or gradients for a student to learn. In this work, we introduce Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a novel paradigm for data-free conceptual transfer between neural networks. M2KT enables models to exchange knowledge packets that encapsulate structured concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, reasoning traces, and provenance metadata. Unlike classical distillation, M2KT operates primarily in concept space rather than example space, and it does not require labeled datasets or teacher-generated outputs during transfer. We formalize the notion of concept manifolds, introduce an inter-model alignment mapping between teacher and student latent spaces, and derive a composite loss that enforces geometric, structural, and reasoning consistency together with explicit safety constraints. We further present algorithmic procedures for teacher-side packet generation and student-side ingestion and verification. Experiments on symbolic reasoning with large language models show that M2KT can achieve approximately 85 to 90 percent of teacher performance while reducing data usage by over 98 percent compared to standard knowledge distillation. This work establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for data-free AI-to-AI knowledge transfer and self-improving model ecosystems.

## 126. Can we use LLMs to bootstrap reinforcement learning? -- A case study in digital health behavior change
- **Authors**: Nele Albers , Esra Cemre Su de Groot , Loes Keijsers , Manon H. Hillegers , Emiel Krahmer
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17630](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17630)
- **Abstract**:
> Personalizing digital applications for health behavior change is a promising route to making them more engaging and effective. This especially holds for approaches that adapt to users and their specific states (e.g., motivation, knowledge, wants) over time. However, developing such approaches requires making many design choices, whose effectiveness is difficult to predict from literature and costly to evaluate in practice. In this work, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can be used out-of-the-box to generate samples of user interactions that provide useful information for training reinforcement learning models for digital behavior change settings. Using real user data from four large behavior change studies as comparison, we show that LLM-generated samples can be useful in the absence of real data. Comparisons to the samples provided by human raters further show that LLM-generated samples reach the performance of human raters. Additional analyses of different prompting strategies including shorter and longer prompt variants, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot prompting show that the relative effectiveness of different strategies depends on both the study and the LLM with also relatively large differences between prompt paraphrases alone. We provide recommendations for how LLM-generated samples can be useful in practice.

## 127. From Competition to Coordination: Market Making as a Scalable Framework for Safe and Aligned Multi-Agent LLM Systems
- **Authors**: Brendan Gho , Suman Muppavarapu , Afnan Shaik , Tyson Tsay , James Begin , Kevin Zhu , Archana Vaidheeswaran , Vasu Sharma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17621](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17621)
- **Abstract**:
> As foundation models are increasingly deployed as interacting agents in multi-agent systems, their collective behavior raises new challenges for trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability. Traditional coordination mechanisms, such as centralized oversight or adversarial adjudication, struggle to scale and often obscure how decisions emerge. We introduce a market-making framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) coordination that organizes agent interactions as structured economic exchanges. In this setup, each agent acts as a market participant, updating and trading probabilistic beliefs, to converge toward shared, truthful outcomes. By aligning local incentives with collective epistemic goals, the framework promotes self-organizing, verifiable reasoning without requiring external enforcement. Empirically, we evaluate this approach across factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference tasks. Market-based coordination yields accuracy gains of up to 10% over single-shot baselines while preserving interpretability and transparency of intermediate reasoning steps. Beyond these improvements, our findings demonstrate that economic coordination principles can operationalize accountability and robustness in multi-agent LLM systems, offering a scalable pathway toward self-correcting, socially responsible AI capable of maintaining trust and oversight in real world deployment scenarios.

## 128. From Projection to Prediction: Beyond Logits for Scalable Language Models
- **Authors**: Jianbing Dong , Jianbin Chang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17599](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17599)
- **Abstract**:
> Training Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves a two-stage pipeline at the output layer: hidden states are projected into vocabulary logits via a linear transformation (lm_head), followed by cross-entropy loss computation against target tokens. While conceptually simple, this design incurs substantial overhead. The intermediate logits tensor, with dimensions proportional to batch size, sequence length, and vocabulary size, must be fully materialized in GPU memory, even though only one target token per position is ultimately used. This leads to significant memory footprint and bandwidth comsumption, limiting scalability and slowing training throughput. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to integrates the output projection and loss prediction into a single operation. By directly computing the loss from hidden states and target tokens, our approach bypasses explicit logits materialization. This design reduces memory usage and alleviates bandwidth pressure. Experiments on LLM training demonstrate that our method achieves substantial memory savings and measurable speedups compared to the standard two-stage pipeline, enabling large batch sizes and longer sequences without sacrificing accuracy. Our work highlights the benefits of rethinking the boundary between projection and prediction, offering a practical systems optimization for efficient LLM training.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17592](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17592)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025; Georgiev et al., 2025), have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. However, the high-level descriptions in published work leave many implementation details unspecified, hindering reproducibility and further research. In this report we present GigaEvo, an extensible open-source framework that enables researchers to study and experiment with hybrid LLM-evolution approaches inspired by AlphaEvolve. Our system provides modular implementations of key components: MAP-Elites quality-diversity algorithms, asynchronous DAG-based evaluation pipelines, LLM-driven mutation operators with insight generation and bidirectional lineage tracking, and flexible multi-island evolutionary strategies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation we evaluate GigaEvo on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: Heilbronn triangle placement, circle packing in squares, and high-dimensional kissing numbers. The framework emphasizes modularity, concurrency, and ease of experimentation, enabling rapid prototyping through declarative configuration. We provide detailed descriptions of system architecture, implementation decisions, and experimental methodology to support further research in LLM driven evolutionary methods. The GigaEvo framework and all experimental code are available at this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17584](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17584)
- **Abstract**:
> Anomaly detection on attributed graphs plays an essential role in applications such as fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, and misinformation analysis. However, text-attributed graphs (TAGs), in which node information is expressed in natural language, remain underexplored, largely due to the absence of standardized benchmark datasets. In this work, we introduce TAG-AD, a comprehensive benchmark for anomaly node detection on TAGs. TAG-AD leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic anomalous node texts directly in the raw text space, producing anomalies that are semantically coherent yet contextually inconsistent and thus more reflective of real-world irregularities. In addition, TAG-AD incorporates multiple other anomaly types, enabling thorough and reproducible evaluation of graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods. With these datasets, we further benchmark existing unsupervised GNN-based GAD methods as well as zero-shot LLMs for GAD. As part of our zero-shot detection setup, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-assisted, LLM-based zero-shot anomaly detection framework. The framework mitigates reliance on brittle, hand-crafted prompts by constructing a global anomaly knowledge base and distilling it into reusable analysis frameworks. Our experimental results reveal a clear division of strengths: LLMs are particularly effective at detecting contextual anomalies, whereas GNN-based methods remain superior for structural anomaly detection. Moreover, RAG-assisted prompting achieves performance comparable to human-designed prompts while eliminating manual prompt engineering, underscoring the practical value of our RAG-assisted zero-shot LLM anomaly detection framework.

## 131. Multi-Value Alignment for LLMs via Value Decorrelation and Extrapolation
- **Authors**: Hefei Xu , Le Wu , Chen Cheng , Hao Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17579](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17579)
- **Abstract**:
> With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), aligning them with human values for safety and ethics has become a critical challenge. This problem is especially challenging when multiple, potentially conflicting human values must be considered and balanced. Although several variants of existing alignment methods (such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)) have been proposed to address multi-value alignment, they suffer from notable limitations: 1) they are often unstable and inefficient in multi-value optimization; and 2) they fail to effectively handle value conflicts. As a result, these approaches typically struggle to achieve optimal trade-offs when aligning multiple values. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Value Alignment (MVA). It mitigates alignment degradation caused by parameter interference among diverse human values by minimizing their mutual information. Furthermore, we propose a value extrapolation strategy to efficiently explore the Pareto frontier, thereby constructing a set of LLMs with diverse value preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVA consistently outperforms existing baselines in aligning LLMs with multiple human values.

However, their substantial computational and storage costs hinder practical deployment. This paper proposes a lightweight optimization method that integrates dynamic attention head pruning with knowledge distillation. The approach dynamically evaluates the importance of each attention head in the multi-head attention mechanism using a combination of weight norms and entropy, and prunes redundant heads in real time to reduce computational overhead. To mitigate performance degradation, knowledge distillation transfers information from the original model to the pruned student, enabling the smaller model to preserve reasoning ability. Experiments conducted on both Math23k and ASDiv-A verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, on Math23k with a 30% pruning ratio, parameters are reduced by 18.7%, inference speed is improved by 27.5%, FLOPs are reduced by 19.3%, and accuracy drops only 0.7% (from 84.4% to 83.7%). These results demonstrate that the method achieves substantial efficiency gains while maintaining strong reasoning performance, providing a practical solution for efficient deployment of large language models in mathematical reasoning tasks.

## 133. Binary BPE: A Family of Cross-Platform Tokenizers for Binary Analysis
- **Authors**: Michael J. Bommarito II
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17573](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17573)
- **Abstract**:
> Sequence models for binary analysis are bottlenecked by byte-level tokenization: raw bytes waste precious context window capacity for transformers and other neural network architectures, and many existing text-oriented tokenizers fail on arbitrary 0x00--0xFF sequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Binary BPE tokenizer family, a set of cross-platform Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers for executables trained on a large corpus of binaries spanning multiple platforms, architectures, and operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and malware sources. We release trained tokenizers with vocabularies of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K tokens, enabling both systematic scaling studies and practical deployment from resource-constrained edge devices to high-throughput datacenters. These tokenizers discover interpretable patterns (ELF/PE headers, instruction sequences, cross-platform strings) while yielding multi-byte compression per token. On representative uncompressed executables (e.g., ELF/PE/Mach-O rather than compressed APKs), the Binary BPE tokenizers typically allow for roughly 2-3x more binary content per fixed-length transformer context window than raw bytes, enabling more efficient research and practical deployment for content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. We release the trained Binary BPE tokenizers on HuggingFace, providing a drop-in, open-source foundation for binary-focused language models and context-efficient agentic tools.

## 134. Generative Caching for Structurally Similar Prompts and Responses

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17565](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17565)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to plan, reason, and execute tasks across diverse scenarios. In use cases like repeatable workflows and agentic settings, prompts are often reused with minor variations while having a similar structure for recurring tasks. This opens up opportunities for caching. However, exact prompt matching fails on such structurally similar prompts, while semantic caching may produce incorrect responses by ignoring critical differences. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod{}, a generative cache that produces variation-aware responses for structurally similar prompts. \ourmethod{} identifies reusable response patterns across similar prompt structures and synthesizes customized outputs for new requests. We show that \ourmethod{} achieves 83\% cache hit rate, while having minimal incorrect hits on datasets without prompt repetition. In agentic workflows, it improves cache hit rate by $\sim$20\% and reduces end-to-end execution latency by $\sim$34\% compared to standard prompt matching.

## 135. LexInstructEval: Lexical Instruction Following Evaluation for Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Huimin Ren , Yan Liang , Baiqiao Su , Chaobo Sun , Hengtong Lu , Kaike Zhang , Chen Wei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17561](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17561)
- **Abstract**:
> The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to precisely follow complex and fine-grained lexical instructions is a cornerstone of their utility and controllability. However, evaluating this capability remains a significant challenge. Current methods either rely on subjective and costly human evaluation or on automated LLM-as-a-judge systems, which suffer from inherent biases and unreliability. Existing programmatic benchmarks, while objective, often lack the expressiveness to test intricate, compositional constraints at a granular level. To address these limitations, we introduce LexInstructEval, a new benchmark and evaluation framework for fine-grained lexical instruction following. Our framework is built upon a formal, rule-based grammar that deconstructs complex instructions into a canonical <Procedure, Relation, Value> triplet. This grammar enables the systematic generation of a diverse dataset through a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop pipeline and facilitates objective verification via a transparent, programmatic engine. We release our dataset and open-source evaluation tools to facilitate further research into the controllability and reliability of LLMs.

## 136. $A^3$: Attention-Aware Accurate KV Cache Fusion for Fast Large Language Model Serving
- **Authors**: Yuechi Zhou , Yi Su , Jianxin Zhang , Juntao Li , Qingrong Xia , Zhefeng Wang , Xinyu Duan , Baoxing Huai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17560](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17560)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing long contexts, enabling them to tackle tasks involving long textual inputs such as multi-turn conversations, legal documents, or retrieved documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. However, despite their ability to handle long sequences, the resulting decoding latency and memory overhead remain substantial, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent advances in KV Cache reuse have shown potential to mitigate these costs, but still suffer from notable performance degradation. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth investigation of recomputation-based reuse methods and observe that the recomputed tokens often fail to align with the context segments most relevant to the question. This misalignment hinders proper updates to the critical contextual representations. Therefore, we propose the $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{A}$ccurate KV Cache Fusion algorithm ($A^3$), which precomputes and selectively fuses the KV Cache of text chunks based on their relevance to the question, achieving accurate integration with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that $A^3$ achieves the best task performance compared to four baselines while reducing the time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2$\times$.

## 137. A Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization (MDO) Agent Driven by Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Bingkun Guo , Wentian Li , Xiaojian Liu , Jiaqi Luo , Zibin Yu , Dalong Dong , Shuyou Zhang , Yiming Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17511](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17511)
- **Abstract**:
> To accelerate mechanical design and enhance design quality and innovation, we present a Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization (MDO) Agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). The agent semi-automates the end-to-end workflow by orchestrating three core capabilities: (i) natural-language-driven parametric modeling, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge-grounded conceptualization, and (iii) intelligent orchestration of engineering software for performance verification and optimization. Working in tandem, these capabilities interpret high-level, unstructured intent, translate it into structured design representations, automatically construct parametric 3D CAD models, generate reliable concept variants using external knowledge bases, and conduct evaluation with iterative optimization via tool calls such as finite-element analysis (FEA). Validation on three representative cases - a gas-turbine blade, a machine-tool column, and a fractal heat sink - shows that the agent completes the pipeline from natural-language intent to verified and optimized designs with reduced manual scripting and setup effort, while promoting innovative design exploration. This work points to a practical path toward human-AI collaborative mechanical engineering and lays a foundation for more dependable, vertically customized MDO systems.

## 138. AURA: Adaptive Unified Reasoning and Automation with LLM-Guided MARL for NextG Cellular Networks
- **Authors**: Narjes Nourzad , Mingyu Zong , Bhaskar Krishnamachari
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17506](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17506)
- **Abstract**:
> Next-generation (NextG) cellular networks are expected to manage dynamic traffic while sustaining high performance. Large language models (LLMs) provide strategic reasoning for 6G planning, but their computational cost and latency limit real-time use. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) supports localized adaptation, yet coordination at scale remains challenging. We present AURA, a framework that integrates cloud-based LLMs for high-level planning with base stations modeled as MARL agents for local decision-making. The LLM generates objectives and subgoals from its understanding of the environment and reasoning capabilities, while agents at base stations execute these objectives autonomously, guided by a trust mechanism that balances local learning with external input. To reduce latency, AURA employs batched communication so that agents update the LLM's view of the environment and receive improved feedback. In a simulated 6G scenario, AURA improves resilience, reducing dropped handoff requests by more than half under normal and high traffic and lowering system failures. Agents use LLM input in fewer than 60\% of cases, showing that guidance augments rather than replaces local adaptability, thereby mitigating latency and hallucination risks. These results highlight the promise of combining LLM reasoning with MARL adaptability for scalable, real-time NextG network management.
