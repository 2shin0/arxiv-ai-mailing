- **Abstract**:
> The evolution of mathematics has been guided in part by interestingness. From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08484](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08484)
- **Abstract**:
> We propose patching for large language models (LLMs) like software versions, a lightweight and modular approach for addressing safety vulnerabilities. While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This "patch" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be "patched" much like software, offering vendors and practitioners a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major model releases.

## 3. FaithAct: Faithfulness Planning and Acting in MLLMs
- **Authors**: Junxian Li , Xinyue Xu , Sai Ma , Sichao Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08409](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08409)
- **Abstract**:
> Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

## 4. SOM Directions are Better than One: Multi-Directional Refusal Suppression in Language Models
- **Authors**: Giorgio Piras , Raffaele Mura , Fabio Brau , Luca Oneto , Fabio Roli , Battista Biggio
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08379](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08379)
- **Abstract**:
> Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

## 5. DiagramIR: An Automatic Pipeline for Educational Math Diagram Evaluation
- **Authors**: Vishal Kumar , Shubhra Mishra , Rebecca Hao , Rizwaan Malik , David Broman , Dorottya Demszky
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08283](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08283)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as tools for learning; however, most tools remain text-only, limiting their usefulness for domains where visualizations are essential, such as mathematics. Recent work shows that LLMs are capable of generating code that compiles to educational figures, but a major bottleneck remains: scalable evaluation of these diagrams. We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters. This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.

## 6. Multi-Agent GraphRAG: A Text-to-Cypher Framework for Labeled Property Graphs
- **Authors**: Anton Gusarov , Anastasia Volkova , Valentin Khrulkov , Andrey Kuznetsov , Evgenii Maslov , Ivan Oseledets
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08274](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08274)
- **Abstract**:
> While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods commonly draw information from unstructured documents, the emerging paradigm of GraphRAG aims to leverage structured data such as knowledge graphs. Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building. This highlights how such an approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation use cases.

- **Abstract**:
> Hit identification is a central challenge in early drug discovery, traditionally requiring substantial experimental resources. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the growing complexity of these tools has limited their accessibility to wet-lab researchers. Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening. We evaluate MADD across seven drug discovery cases and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing LLM-based solutions. Using MADD, we pioneer the application of AI-first drug design to five biological targets and release the identified hit molecules. Finally, we introduce a new benchmark of query-molecule pairs and docking scores for over three million compounds to contribute to the agentic future of drug design.

## 9. Towards Provably Unlearnable Examples via Bayes Error Optimisation
- **Authors**: Ruihan Zhang , Jun Sun , Ee-Peng Lim , Peixin Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08191](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08191)
- **Abstract**:
> The recent success of machine learning models, especially large-scale classifiers and language models, relies heavily on training with massive data. These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.

## 10. An Efficient Training Pipeline for Reasoning Graphical User Interface Agents
- **Authors**: Georgios Pantazopoulos , Eda B. Özyiğit
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08172](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08172)
- **Abstract**:
> Visual grounding is the task of localising image regions from natural language queries and is critical for reasoning capable Graphical User Interface agents. Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic this http URL work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought- augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.

- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models have enabled AI systems to achieve expert-level performance on domain-specific scientific tasks, yet these systems remain narrow and handcrafted. We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.

## 12. National Institute on Aging PREPARE Challenge: Early Detection of Cognitive Impairment Using Speech - The SpeechCARE Solution
- **Authors**: Maryam Zolnoori , Hossein Azadmaleki , Yasaman Haghbin , Ali Zolnour , Mohammad Javad Momeni Nezhad , Sina Rashidi , Mehdi Naserian , Elyas Esmaeili , Sepehr Karimi Arpanahi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08132](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08132)
- **Abstract**:
> Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.

## 13. Prudential Reliability of Large Language Models in Reinsurance: Governance, Assurance, and Capital Efficiency
- **Authors**: Stella C. Dong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08082](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08082)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.

## 14. Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression
- **Authors**: Cheng Yuan , Jiawei Shao , Chi Zhang , Xuelong Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

## 15. MSCR: Exploring the Vulnerability of LLMs' Mathematical Reasoning Abilities Using Multi-Source Candidate Replacement
- **Authors**: Zhishen Sun , Guang Dai , Haishan Ye
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08055](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08055)
- **Abstract**:
> LLMs demonstrate performance comparable to human abilities in complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning, but their robustness in mathematical reasoning under minor input perturbations still lacks systematic investigation. Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption. These findings highlight the robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks.

## 16. Dual-Process Scaffold Reasoning for Enhancing LLM Code Debugging
- **Authors**: Po-Chung Hsieh , Chin-Po Chen , Jeng-Lin Li , Ming-Ching Chang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08052](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08052)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent LLMs have demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving capabilities on various benchmarks through advanced reasoning algorithms. However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.

## 17. Towards a Standard, Enterprise-Relevant Agentic AI Benchmark: Lessons from 5.5 billion tokens' worth of agentic AI evaluations
- **Authors**: JV Roig
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08042](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08042)
- **Abstract**:
> Enterprise adoption of agentic AI systems requires reliable evaluation methods that reflect real-world deployment scenarios. Traditional LLM benchmarks suffer from training data contamination and fail to measure agentic capabilities such as multi-step tool use and decision-making under uncertainty. We present the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1, an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses both contamination resistance and agentic evaluation. Through 170,000 LLM test items processing over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations, we demonstrate that traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance. Notably, newer generation models like Llama 4 or Qwen 3 do not always outperform their older generation variants on enterprise-relevant tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends. We also present insights on cost-performance tradeoffs, model-specific behavioral patterns, and the impact of reasoning capabilities on token efficiency -- findings critical for enterprises making deployment decisions.

## 18. Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Generation for Complex Biomolecular Reasoning
- **Authors**: Tianwen Lyu , Xiang Zhuang , Keyan Ding , Xinzhe Cao , Lei Liang , Wei Zhao , Qiang Zhang , Huajun Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08024)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding complex biomolecular mechanisms requires multi-step reasoning across molecular interactions, signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways. While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.

## 19. Numerical Sensitivity and Robustness: Exploring the Flaws of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Zhishen Sun , Guang Dai , Ivor Tsang , Haishan Ye
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08022)
- **Abstract**:
> LLMs have made significant progress in the field of mathematical reasoning, but whether they have true the mathematical understanding ability is still controversial. To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs.

## 20. Combining LLM Semantic Reasoning with GNN Structural Modeling for Multi-view Multi-Label Feature Selection
- **Authors**: Zhiqi Chen , Yuzhou Liu , Jiarui Liu , Wanfu Gao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08008](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08008)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

## 21. VSPO: Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology via LLM-Based CQ Generation
- **Authors**: Hyojun Choi , Seokju Hwang , Kyong-Ho Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07991](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07991)
- **Abstract**:
> Competency Questions (CQs) play a crucial role in validating ontology design. While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as "Misusing allValuesFrom". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

## 22. Benchmarking Multi-Step Legal Reasoning and Analyzing Chain-of-Thought Effects in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Wenhan Yu , Xinbo Lin , Lanxin Ni , Jinhua Cheng , Lei Sha
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07979](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07979)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07943](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07943)
- **Abstract**:
> Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes. The source code is available at this https URL .

## 24. Computational Blueprints: Generating Isomorphic Mathematics Problems with Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Jeong-Hoon Kim , Jinwoo Nam , Geunsik Jo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07932](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07932)
- **Abstract**:
> Personalized mathematics education is growing rapidly, creating a strong demand for large sets of similar practice problems. Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale. Most importantly, CBIT-generated problems exhibited an error rate 17.8% lower than expert-authored items, with deployment to 6,732 learners on a commercial education platform yielding 186,870 interactions.

## 25. Neurophysiological Characteristics of Adaptive Reasoning for Creative Problem-Solving Strategy
- **Authors**: Jun-Young Kim , Young-Seok Kweon , Gi-Hwan Shin , Seong-Whan Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07912)
- **Abstract**:
> Adaptive reasoning enables humans to flexibly adjust inference strategies when environmental rules or contexts change, yet its underlying neural dynamics remain unclear. This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

## 26. Data Descriptions from Large Language Models with Influence Estimation
- **Authors**: Chaeri Kim , Jaeyeon Bae , Taehwan Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07897](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07897)
- **Abstract**:
> Deep learning models have been successful in many areas but understanding their behaviors still remains a black-box. Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.

## 27. SparseRM: A Lightweight Preference Modeling with Sparse Autoencoder

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07896](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07896)
- **Abstract**:
> Reward models (RMs) are a core component in the post-training of large language models (LLMs), serving as proxies for human preference evaluation and guiding model alignment. However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.

## 28. WaterMod: Modular Token-Rank Partitioning for Probability-Balanced LLM Watermarking
- **Authors**: Shinwoo Park , Hyejin Park , Hyeseon Ahn , Yo-Sub Han
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07863](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07863)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. Our code and data are available at this https URL .

## 29. Alignment-Aware Quantization for LLM Safety
- **Authors**: Sunghyun Wee , Suyoung Kim , Hyeonjin Kim , Kyomin Hwang , Nojun Kwak
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07842](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07842)
- **Abstract**:
> Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy. Anonymized code is available in the supplementary material.

## 30. Towards AI-Assisted Generation of Military Training Scenarios
- **Authors**: Soham Hans , Volkan Ustun , Benjamin Nye , James Sterrett , Matthew Green
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07690](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07690)
- **Abstract**:
> Achieving expert-level performance in simulation-based training relies on the creation of complex, adaptable scenarios, a traditionally laborious and resource intensive process. Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07685)
- **Abstract**:
> Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

- **Abstract**:
> This technical report describes the AIA Forecaster, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system for judgmental forecasting using unstructured data. The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that verifiably achieves expert-level forecasting at scale.

## 33. Making LLMs Reliable When It Matters Most: A Five-Layer Architecture for High-Stakes Decisions
- **Authors**: Alejandro R. Jadad
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07669)
- **Abstract**:
> Current large language models (LLMs) excel in verifiable domains where outputs can be checked before action but prove less reliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes. This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector. This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection. Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures. This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.

## 34. AI-Driven Contribution Evaluation and Conflict Resolution: A Framework & Design for Group Workload Investigation
- **Authors**: Jakub Slapek , Mir Seyedebrahimi , Yang Jianhua
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07667](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07667)
- **Abstract**:
> The equitable assessment of individual contribution in teams remains a persistent challenge, where conflict and disparity in workload can result in unfair performance evaluation, often requiring manual intervention - a costly and challenging process. We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role. Objective measures are normalised, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to surface conflict markers. A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture performs validated and contextual analysis over these measures to generate interpretable and transparent advisory judgments. We argue for feasibility under current statutory and institutional policy, and outline practical analytics (sentimental, task fidelity, word/line count, etc.), bias safeguards, limitations, and practical challenges.

## 35. Beyond Fact Retrieval: Episodic Memory for RAG with Generative Semantic Workspaces
- **Authors**: Shreyas Rajesh , Pavan Holur , Chenda Duan , David Chong , Vwani Roychowdhury
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07587](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07587)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \textbf{20\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \textbf{51\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

## 36. Think Before You Retrieve: Learning Test-Time Adaptive Search with Small Language Models
- **Authors**: Supriti Vijay , Aman Priyanshu , Anu Vellore , Baturay Saglam , Amin Karbasi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07581](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07581)
- **Abstract**:
> Effective information retrieval requires reasoning over partial evidence and refining strategies as information emerges. Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.

## 37. Procedural Knowledge Improves Agentic LLM Workflows
- **Authors**: Vincent Hsiao , Mark Roberts , Leslie Smith
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07568](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07568)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) often struggle when performing agentic tasks without substantial tool support, prom-pt engineering, or fine tuning. Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows.

## 38. Beyond Correctness: Confidence-Aware Reward Modeling for Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning
- **Authors**: Qianxi He , Qingyu Ren , Shanzhe Lei , Xuhong Wang , Yingchun Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07483](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07483)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted the post-training paradigm from traditional instruction tuning and human preference alignment toward reinforcement learning (RL) focused on reasoning capabilities. However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in this https URL .

## 39. Analysing Environmental Efficiency in AI for X-Ray Diagnosis
- **Authors**: Liam Kearns
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07436](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07436)
- **Abstract**:
> The integration of AI tools into medical applications has aimed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks.

## 40. Training Language Models to Explain Their Own Computations

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08579](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08579)
- **Abstract**:
> Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

## 41. Think-at-Hard: Selective Latent Iterations to Improve Reasoning Language Models
- **Authors**: Tianyu Fu , Yichen You , Zekai Chen , Guohao Dai , Huazhong Yang , Yu Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08577](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08577)
- **Abstract**:
> Improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially under parameter constraints, is crucial for real-world applications. Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively. Our code is available at this https URL .

- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) reliably improves the reasoning performance of large language models, yet it appears to modify only a small fraction of parameters. We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR. Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.

> Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in social contexts, motivating analysis of how they express and shift moral judgments. In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models. Together, these analyses provide a systematic view of how persona conditioning shapes moral behavior in large language models.

- **Authors**: Sen Zhang , Xiaoxiao He , Di Liu , Zhaoyang Xia , Mingyu Zhao , Chaowei Tan , Vivian Li , Bo Liu , Dimitris N. Metaxas , Mubbasir Kapadia
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08535)
- **Abstract**:
> We present Large Sign Language Models (LSLM), a novel framework for translating 3D American Sign Language (ASL) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone, which can benefit hearing-impaired individuals' virtual communication. Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility. This work provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language.

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) adapted to financial domains often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of general reasoning capabilities essential for customer interactions and complex financial analysis. We introduce Selective Parameter Evaluation and Restoration via Model Merging (SPEAR-MM), a practical framework that preserves critical capabilities while enabling domain adaptation. Our method approximates layer-wise impact on external benchmarks through post-hoc analysis, then selectively freezes or restores transformer layers via spherical interpolation merging. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B for financial tasks, SPEAR-MM achieves 91.2% retention of general capabilities versus 69.7% for standard continual pretraining, while maintaining 94% of domain adaptation gains. The approach provides interpretable trade-off control and reduces computational costs by 90% crucial for resource-constrained financial institutions.

- **Authors**: Yangxiao Cai , Ruiyin Li , Peng Liang , Mojtaba Shahin , Zengyang Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08475](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08475)
- **Abstract**:
> As the complexity of Software Engineering (SE) tasks continues to escalate, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a focal point of research and practice due to their autonomy and scalability. Furthermore, through leveraging the reasoning and planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), the application of LLM-based MASs in the field of SE is garnering increasing attention. However, there is no dedicated study that systematically explores the design of LLM-based MASs, including the Quality Attributes (QAs) on which the designers mainly focus, the design patterns used by the designers, and the rationale guiding the design of LLM-based MASs for SE tasks. To this end, we conducted a study to identify the QAs that LLM-based MASs for SE tasks focus on, the design patterns used in the MASs, and the design rationale for the MASs. We collected 94 papers on LLM-based MASs for SE tasks as the source. Our study shows that: (1) Code Generation is the most common SE task solved by LLM-based MASs among ten identified SE tasks, (2) Functional Suitability is the QA on which designers of LLM-based MASs pay the most attention, (3) Role-Based Cooperation is the design pattern most frequently employed among 16 patterns used to construct LLM-based MASs, and (4) Improving the Quality of Generated Code is the most common rationale behind the design of LLM-based MASs. Based on the study results, we presented the implications for the design of LLM-based MASs to support SE tasks.

## 47. Anatomy-VLM: A Fine-grained Vision-Language Model for Medical Interpretation
- **Authors**: Difei Gu , Yunhe Gao , Mu Zhou , Dimitris Metaxas
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08402](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08402)
- **Abstract**:
> Accurate disease interpretation from radiology remains challenging due to imaging heterogeneity. Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.

## 48. Interaction Dynamics as a Reward Signal for LLMs
- **Authors**: Sian Gooding , Edward Grefenstette
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08394](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08394)
- **Abstract**:
> The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversations typically relies on reward signals derived from the content of the text. This approach, however, overlooks a rich, complementary source of signal: the dynamics of the interaction itself. This paper introduces TRACE (Trajectory-based Reward for Agent Collaboration Estimation), a novel reward signal derived from the geometric properties of a dialogue's embedding trajectory--a concept we term 'conversational geometry'. Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature. This work provides strong evidence that for interactive settings, how an agent communicates is as powerful a predictor of success as what it says, offering a new, privacy-preserving framework that not only aligns agents but also serves as a diagnostic tool for understanding the distinct interaction patterns that drive successful collaboration.

- **Authors**: Xinyi Wang , Yiping Song , Zhiliang Tian , Bo Liu , Tingjin Luo , Minlie Huang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08364](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08364)
- **Abstract**:
> In multi-hop question answering (MHQA) tasks, Chain of Thought (CoT) improves the quality of generation by guiding large language models (LLMs) through multi-step reasoning, and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) reduce hallucinations via semantic matching. Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards. Experimental results show that our method outperforms 13 baselines on multiple datasets with up to 16.6% improvement on Hit@1.

- **Authors**: Amin Ebrahimi , Farzan Haddadi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08349](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08349)
- **Abstract**:
> Hybrid Quantum Classical (HQC) algorithms constitute one of the most effective paradigms for exploiting the computational advantages of quantum systems in large-scale numerical tasks. By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization. In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning. We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced gating mechanisms as a path toward scalable, resource-efficient NLP models, in a limited simulation step. Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding

## 51. Adaptive Multi-Agent Response Refinement in Conversational Systems
- **Authors**: Soyeong Jeong , Aparna Elangovan , Emine Yilmaz , Oleg Rokhlenko
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08319)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in conversational systems by generating human-like responses. However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.

## 52. Test-time Diverse Reasoning by Riemannian Activation Steering
- **Authors**: Ly Tran Ho Khanh , Dongxuan Zhu , Man-Chung Yue , Viet Anh Nguyen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08305](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08305)
- **Abstract**:
> Best-of-$N$ reasoning improves the accuracy of language models in solving complex tasks by sampling multiple candidate solutions and then selecting the best one based on some criteria. A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.

## 53. Benchmarking Educational LLMs with Analytics: A Case Study on Gender Bias in Feedback
- **Authors**: Yishan Du , Conrad Borchers , Mutlu Cukurova
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08225](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08225)
- **Abstract**:
> As teachers increasingly turn to GenAI in their educational practice, we need robust methods to benchmark large language models (LLMs) for pedagogical purposes. This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08181)
- **Abstract**:
> Recommender systems (RS) are currently being studied to mitigate limitations during cold-start conditions by leveraging modality information or introducing Agent concepts based on the exceptional reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, food and beverage recommender systems have traditionally used knowledge graph and ontology concepts due to the domain's unique data attributes and relationship characteristics. On this background, we propose MARC, a multimodal and multi-task cocktail recommender system based on Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizing graph database under cold-start conditions. The proposed system generates high-quality, contextually appropriate answers through two core processes: a task recognition router and a reflection process. The graph database was constructed by processing cocktail data from Kaggle, and its effectiveness was evaluated using 200 manually crafted questions. The evaluation used both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluation to demonstrate that answers generated via the graph database outperformed those from a simple vector database in terms of quality.

## 55. Relation as a Prior: A Novel Paradigm for LLM-based Document-level Relation Extraction
- **Authors**: Qiankun Pi , Yepeng Sun , Jicang Lu , Qinlong Fan , Ningbo Huang , Shiyu Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08143](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08143)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities in document understanding. However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted "extract entities then predict relations" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLM-based methods.

- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models have significantly broadened their application in robotics and collaborative systems. However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms in advancing LLMs' application in robotics and multi-agent systems, setting a foundation for future research into adaptive and context-aware AI systems.

## 57. CLIP is All You Need for Human-like Semantic Representations in Stable Diffusion
- **Authors**: Cameron Braunstein , Mariya Toneva , Eddy Ilg
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08075](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08075)
- **Abstract**:
> Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion achieve state-of-the-art results on text-to-image generation tasks. However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08012](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08012)
- **Abstract**:
> Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation is critical in spatial audio and acoustic signal processing, with wide-ranging applications in real-world. Most existing DOA models are trained on synthetic data by convolving clean speech with room impulse responses (RIRs), which limits their generalizability due to constrained acoustic diversity. In this paper, we revisit DOA estimation using a recently introduced dataset constructed with the assistance of large language models (LLMs), which provides more realistic and diverse spatial audio scenes. We benchmark several representative neural-based DOA methods on this dataset and propose LightDOA, a lightweight DOA estimation model based on depthwise separable convolutions, specifically designed for mutil-channel input in varying environments. Experimental results show that LightDOA achieves satisfactory accuracy and robustness across various acoustic scenes while maintaining low computational complexity. This study not only highlights the potential of spatial audio synthesized with the assistance of LLMs in advancing robust and efficient DOA estimation research, but also highlights LightDOA as efficient solution for resource-constrained applications.

## 59. Sharp Eyes and Memory for VideoLLMs: Information-Aware Visual Token Pruning for Efficient and Reliable VideoLLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Jialong Qin , Xin Zou , Di Lu , Yibo Yan , Xuming Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08003](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08003)
- **Abstract**:
> Current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) suffer from quadratic computational complexity and key-value cache scaling, due to their reliance on processing excessive redundant visual tokens. To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, SharpV is notably the first two-stage pruning framework that operates without requiring access to exposed attention scores, ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07998](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07998)
- **Abstract**:
> Structured data question answering (QA), including table QA, Knowledge Graph (KG) QA, and temporal KG QA, is a pivotal research area. Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets. Furthermore, large-scale LLMs equipped with EPM surpass the state-of-the-art results on most datasets.

## 61. State of the Art in Text Classification for South Slavic Languages: Fine-Tuning or Prompting?
- **Authors**: Taja Kuzman Pungeršek , Peter Rupnik , Ivan Porupski , Vuk Dinić , Nikola Ljubešić
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07989](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07989)
- **Abstract**:
> Until recently, fine-tuned BERT-like models provided state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks. With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs. Due to these limitations, fine-tuned BERT-like models remain a more practical choice for large-scale automatic text annotation.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07982](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07982)
- **Abstract**:
> Accurate interpretation of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) is critical for aviation safety, yet their condensed and cryptic language poses significant challenges to both manual and automated processing. Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.

- **Authors**: Zhenfeng Zhuang , Fangyu Zhou , Liansheng Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07941)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a promising direction in computational pathology, the substantial computational cost of giga-pixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates the use of Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to enable effective modeling. A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.

- **Abstract**:
> Accurate segmentation of marine organisms is vital for biodiversity monitoring and ecological assessment, yet existing datasets and models remain largely limited to terrestrial scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{AquaOV255}, the first large-scale and fine-grained underwater segmentation dataset containing 255 categories and over 20K images, covering diverse categories for open-vocabulary (OV) evaluation. Furthermore, we establish the first underwater OV segmentation benchmark, \textbf{UOVSBench}, by integrating AquaOV255 with five additional underwater datasets to enable comprehensive evaluation. Alongside, we present \textbf{Earth2Ocean}, a training-free OV segmentation framework that transfers terrestrial vision--language models (VLMs) to underwater domains without any additional underwater training. Earth2Ocean consists of two core components: a Geometric-guided Visual Mask Generator (\textbf{GMG}) that refines visual features via self-similarity geometric priors for local structure perception, and a Category-visual Semantic Alignment (\textbf{CSA}) module that enhances text embeddings through multimodal large language model reasoning and scene-aware template construction. Extensive experiments on the UOVSBench benchmark demonstrate that Earth2Ocean achieves significant performance improvement on average while maintaining efficient inference.

- **Abstract**:
> Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking.

## 66. LoopLLM: Transferable Energy-Latency Attacks in LLMs via Repetitive Generation
- **Authors**: Xingyu Li , Xiaolei Liu , Cheng Liu , Yixiao Xu , Kangyi Ding , Bangzhou Xin , Jia-Li Yin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07876](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07876)
- **Abstract**:
> As large language models (LLMs) scale, their inference incurs substantial computational resources, exposing them to energy-latency attacks, where crafted prompts induce high energy and latency cost. Existing attack methods aim to prolong output by delaying the generation of termination symbols. However, as the output grows longer, controlling the termination symbols through input becomes difficult, making these methods less effective. Therefore, we propose LoopLLM, an energy-latency attack framework based on the observation that repetitive generation can trigger low-entropy decoding loops, reliably compelling LLMs to generate until their output limits. LoopLLM introduces (1) a repetition-inducing prompt optimization that exploits autoregressive vulnerabilities to induce repetitive generation, and (2) a token-aligned ensemble optimization that aggregates gradients to improve cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments on 12 open-source and 2 commercial LLMs show that LoopLLM significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 90% of the maximum output length, compared to 20% for baselines, and improving transferability by around 40% to DeepSeek-V3 and Gemini 2.5 Flash.

## 67. LLM-Powered Fully Automated Chaos Engineering: Towards Enabling Anyone to Build Resilient Software Systems at Low Cost
- **Authors**: Daisuke Kikuta , Hiroki Ikeuchi , Kengo Tajiri
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07865](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07865)
- **Abstract**:
> Chaos Engineering (CE) is an engineering technique aimed at improving the resilience of distributed systems. It involves intentionally injecting faults into a system to test its resilience, uncover weaknesses, and address them before they cause failures in production. Recent CE tools automate the execution of predefined CE experiments. However, planning such experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. These processes are labor-intensive and require multi-domain expertise. To address these challenges and enable anyone to build resilient systems at low cost, this paper proposes ChaosEater, a system that automates the entire CE cycle with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines an agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided processes within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for software systems built on Kubernetes. Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater complete CE cycles through software engineering tasks, including requirement definition, code generation, testing, and debugging. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on small- and large-scale Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it consistently completes reasonable CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. Its cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07833](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07833)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, while effective on reasoning benchmarks, struggle with agentic tasks that require iterative decision-making. We introduce Murphy, a multi-turn reflective optimization framework that extends GRPO by incorporating iterative self-correction during training. By leveraging both quantitative and qualitative execution feedback, Murphy enables models to progressively refine their reasoning across multiple turns. Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with model families such as Qwen and OLMo show that Murphy consistently improves performance, achieving up to a 8% relative gain in pass@1 over GRPO, on similar compute budgets.

- **Authors**: Haida Feng , Hao Wei , Zewen Xu , Haolin Wang , Chade Li , Yihong Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07813)
- **Abstract**:
> Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored widely for 3D scene understanding. Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Sparse3DPR, which achieves a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and a 78.2% speedup compared with ConceptGraphs on the Space3D-Bench. Moreover, Sparse3DPR obtains comparable performance to training-based methods on ScanQA, with additional real-world experiments confirming its robustness and generalization capability.

## 70. Judging by the Rules: Compliance-Aligned Framework for Modern Slavery Statement Monitoring
- **Authors**: Wenhao Xu , Akshatha Arodi , Jian-Yun Nie , Arsene Fansi Tchango
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07803](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07803)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern slavery affects millions of people worldwide, and regulatory frameworks such as Modern Slavery Acts now require companies to publish detailed disclosures. However, these statements are often vague and inconsistent, making manual review time-consuming and difficult to scale. While NLP offers a promising path forward, high-stakes compliance tasks require more than accurate classification: they demand transparent, rule-aligned outputs that legal experts can verify. Existing applications of large language models (LLMs) often reduce complex regulatory assessments to binary decisions, lacking the necessary structure for robust legal scrutiny. We argue that compliance verification is fundamentally a rule-matching problem: it requires evaluating whether textual statements adhere to well-defined regulatory rules. To this end, we propose a novel framework that harnesses AI for rule-level compliance verification while preserving expert oversight. At its core is the Compliance Alignment Judge (CA-Judge), which evaluates model-generated justifications based on their fidelity to statutory requirements. Using this feedback, we train the Compliance Alignment LLM (CALLM), a model that produces rule-consistent, human-verifiable outputs. CALLM improves predictive performance and generates outputs that are both transparent and legally grounded, offering a more verifiable and actionable solution for real-world compliance analysis.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07772)
- **Abstract**:
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into personal assistants with access to sensitive user data, they face a critical privacy challenge: while prior work has addressed output-level privacy, recent findings reveal that LLMs often leak private information through their internal reasoning processes, violating contextual privacy expectations. These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07748](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07748)
- **Abstract**:
> AI-assisted ultrasound video diagnosis presents new opportunities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging analysis. However, existing research remains limited in terms of dataset diversity, diagnostic performance, and clinical applicability. In this study, we propose \textbf{Auto-US}, an intelligent diagnosis agent that integrates ultrasound video data with clinical diagnostic text. To support this, we constructed \textbf{CUV Dataset} of 495 ultrasound videos spanning five categories and three organs, aggregated from multiple open-access sources. We developed \textbf{CTU-Net}, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in ultrasound video classification, reaching an accuracy of 86.73\% Furthermore, by incorporating large language models, Auto-US is capable of generating clinically meaningful diagnostic suggestions. The final diagnostic scores for each case exceeded 3 out of 5 and were validated by professional clinicians. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical potential of Auto-US in real-world ultrasound applications. Code and data are available at: this https URL .

## 73. ViPRA: Video Prediction for Robot Actions
- **Authors**: Sandeep Routray , Hengkai Pan , Unnat Jain , Shikhar Bahl , Deepak Pathak
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07732](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07732)
- **Abstract**:
> Can we turn a video prediction model into a robot policy? Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks. We will release models and code at this https URL

## 74. CAPO: Confidence Aware Preference Optimization Learning for Multilingual Preferences
- **Authors**: Rhitabrat Pokharel , Yufei Tao , Ameeta Agrawal
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07691](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07691)
- **Abstract**:
> Preference optimization is a critical post-training technique used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, typically by fine-tuning on ranked response pairs. While methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have proven effective in English, they often fail to generalize robustly to multilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective alternative, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on a relative reward. By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text. Empirically, CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy, and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07663](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07663)
- **Abstract**:
> Snowflake's Cortex AISQL is a production SQL engine that integrates native semantic operations directly into SQL. This integration allows users to write declarative queries that combine relational operations with semantic reasoning, enabling them to query both structured and unstructured data effortlessly. However, making semantic operations efficient at production scale poses fundamental challenges. Semantic operations are more expensive than traditional SQL operations, possess distinct latency and throughput characteristics, and their cost and selectivity are unknown during query compilation. Furthermore, existing query engines are not designed to optimize semantic operations. The AISQL query execution engine addresses these challenges through three novel techniques informed by production deployment data from Snowflake customers. First, AI-aware query optimization treats AI inference cost as a first-class optimization objective, reasoning about large language model (LLM) cost directly during query planning to achieve 2-8$\times$ speedups. Second, adaptive model cascades reduce inference costs by routing most rows through a fast proxy model while escalating uncertain cases to a powerful oracle model, achieving 2-6$\times$ speedups while maintaining 90-95% of oracle model quality. Third, semantic join query rewriting lowers the quadratic time complexity of join operations to linear through reformulation as multi-label classification tasks, achieving 15-70$\times$ speedups with often improved prediction quality. AISQL is deployed in production at Snowflake, where it powers diverse customer workloads across analytics, search, and content understanding.

## 76. Revisiting NLI: Towards Cost-Effective and Human-Aligned Metrics for Evaluating LLMs in Question Answering
- **Authors**: Sai Shridhar Balamurali , Lu Cheng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07659](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07659)
- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating answers from state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) is challenging: lexical metrics miss semantic nuances, whereas "LLM-as-Judge" scoring is computationally expensive. We re-evaluate a lightweight alternative -- off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) scoring augmented by a simple lexical-match flag and find that this decades-old technique matches GPT-4o's accuracy (89.9%) on long-form QA, while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters. To test human alignment of these metrics rigorously, we introduce DIVER-QA, a new 3000-sample human-annotated benchmark spanning five QA datasets and five candidate LLMs. Our results highlight that inexpensive NLI-based evaluation remains competitive and offer DIVER-QA as an open resource for future metric research.

## 77. A Self-Improving Architecture for Dynamic Safety in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Tyler Slater
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07645](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07645)
- **Abstract**:
> Context: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into core software systems is accelerating. However, existing software architecture patterns are static, while current safety assurance methods are not scalable, leaving systems vulnerable to novel adversarial threats. Objective: To design, implement, and evaluate a novel software architecture that enables an AI-driven system to autonomously and continuously adapt its own safety protocols at runtime. Method: We propose the Self-Improving Safety Framework (SISF), a runtime architecture that couples an unprotected, unaligned base LLM (mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) with a dynamic feedback loop. This loop consists of an AI Adjudicator (GPT-4o) for breach detection and a Policy Synthesis Module (GPT-4 Turbo) that autonomously generates new, generalized safety policies (both heuristic and semantic) in response to failures. Results: We conducted a dynamic learning evaluation using the 520-prompt AdvBench dataset. The unprotected model was 100% vulnerable. Our SISF, starting from zero policies, demonstrated a clear learning curve: it detected 237 breaches, autonomously synthesized 234 new policies, and reduced the overall Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 45.58%. In a subsequent test on 520 benign prompts, the SISF achieved a 0.00% False Positive Rate (FPR), proving its ability to adapt without compromising user utility. Conclusion: An architectural approach to AI safety, based on the principles of self-adaptation, is a viable and effective strategy. Our framework demonstrates a practical path towards building more robust, resilient, and scalable AI-driven systems, shifting safety assurance from a static, pre-deployment activity to an automated, runtime process.

## 78. Private-RAG: Answering Multiple Queries with LLMs while Keeping Your Data Private
- **Authors**: Ruihan Wu , Erchi Wang , Zhiyuan Zhang , Yu-Xiang Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07637](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07637)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving documents from an external corpus at inference time. When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents. Our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods scale to hundreds of queries within a practical DP budget ($\varepsilon\approx10$), while preserving meaningful utility.

## 79. LLM Output Drift: Cross-Provider Validation & Mitigation for Financial Workflows
- **Authors**: Raffi Khatchadourian , Rolando Franco
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07585](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07585)
- **Abstract**:
> Financial institutions deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) for reconciliations, regulatory reporting, and client communications, but nondeterministic outputs (output drift) undermine auditability and trust. We quantify drift across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on regulated financial tasks, revealing a stark inverse relationship: smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency (95% CI: 3.5-36.0%) regardless of configuration (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This finding challenges conventional assumptions that larger models are universally superior for production deployment. Our contributions include: (i) a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (T=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering; (ii) task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (plus or minus 5%) and SEC citation validation; (iii) a three-tier model classification system enabling risk-appropriate deployment decisions; and (iv) an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation. We evaluated five models (Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, Granite-3-8B via IBM this http URL , Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral-Medium-2505, and GPT-OSS-120B) across three regulated financial tasks. Across 480 runs (n=16 per condition), structured tasks (SQL) remain stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks show drift (25-75%), revealing task-dependent sensitivity. Cross-provider validation confirms deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments. We map our framework to Financial Stability Board (FSB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requirements, demonstrating practical pathways for compliance-ready AI deployments.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07584](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07584)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development by enabling automated code generation, yet they frequently suffer from systematic errors that limit practical deployment. We identify two critical failure modes: \textit{logical hallucination} (incorrect control/data-flow reasoning) and \textit{schematic hallucination} (type mismatches, signature violations, and architectural inconsistencies). These errors stem from the absence of explicit, queryable representations of repository-wide semantics. This paper presents \textbf{SemanticForge}, which introduces four fundamental algorithmic advances for semantically-aware code generation: (1) a novel automatic reconciliation algorithm for dual static-dynamic knowledge graphs, unifying compile-time and runtime program semantics; (2) a neural approach that learns to generate structured graph queries from natural language, achieving 73\% precision versus 51\% for traditional retrieval; (3) a novel beam search algorithm with integrated SMT solving, enabling real-time constraint verification during generation rather than post-hoc validation; and (4) an incremental maintenance algorithm that updates knowledge graphs in $O(|\Delta R| \cdot \log n)$ time while maintaining semantic equivalence.

## 81. FedRW: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Data Reweighting for Enhancing Federated Learning of Language Models
- **Authors**: Pukang Ye , Junwei Luo , Xiaolei Dong , Yunbo Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07505](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07505)
- **Abstract**:
> Data duplication within large-scale corpora often impedes large language models' (LLMs) performance and privacy. In privacy-concerned federated learning scenarios, conventional deduplication methods typically rely on trusted third parties to perform uniform deletion, risking loss of informative samples while introducing privacy vulnerabilities. To address these gaps, we propose Federated ReWeighting (FedRW), the first privacy-preserving framework, to the best of our knowledge, that performs soft deduplication via sample reweighting instead of deletion in federated LLM training, without assuming a trusted third party. At its core, FedRW proposes a secure, frequency-aware reweighting protocol through secure multi-party computation, coupled with a parallel orchestration strategy to ensure efficiency and scalability. During training, FedRW utilizes an adaptive reweighting mechanism with global sample frequencies to adjust individual loss contributions, effectively improving generalization and robustness. Empirical results demonstrate that FedRW outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving up to 28.78x speedup in preprocessing and approximately 11.42% improvement in perplexity, while offering enhanced security guarantees. FedRW thus establishes a new paradigm for managing duplication in federated LLM training.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07503](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07503)
- **Abstract**:
> The increased availability of genetic data has transformed genomics research, but raised many privacy concerns regarding its handling due to its sensitive nature. This work explores the use of language models (LMs) for the generation of synthetic genetic mutation profiles, leveraging differential privacy (DP) for the protection of sensitive genetic data. We empirically evaluate the privacy guarantees of our DP modes by introducing a novel Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attack (biHMIA), which combines traditional black box MIA with contextual genomics metrics for enhanced attack power. Our experiments show that both small and large transformer GPT-like models are viable synthetic variant generators for small-scale genomics, and that our hybrid attack leads, on average, to higher adversarial success compared to traditional metric-based MIAs.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07498](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07498)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support multilingual understanding and generation. Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA.

- **Authors**: Euihyeok Lee , Seonghyeon Kim , SangHun Im , Heung-Seon Oh , Seungwoo Kang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07493](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07493)
- **Abstract**:
> Self-talk-an internal dialogue that can occur silently or be spoken aloud-plays a crucial role in emotional regulation, cognitive processing, and motivation, yet has remained largely invisible and unmeasurable in everyday life. In this paper, we present MutterMeter, a mobile system that automatically detects vocalized self-talk from audio captured by earable microphones in real-world settings. Detecting self-talk is technically challenging due to its diverse acoustic forms, semantic and grammatical incompleteness, and irregular occurrence patterns, which differ fundamentally from assumptions underlying conventional speech understanding models. To address these challenges, MutterMeter employs a hierarchical classification architecture that progressively integrates acoustic, linguistic, and contextual information through a sequential processing pipeline, adaptively balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. We build and evaluate MutterMeter using a first-of-its-kind dataset comprising 31.1 hours of audio collected from 25 participants. Experimental results demonstrate that MutterMeter achieves robust performance with a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.84, outperforming conventional approaches, including LLM-based and speech emotion recognition models.

- **Authors**: Dev Patel , Gabrielle Gervacio , Diekola Raimi , Kevin Zhu , Ryan Lagasse , Gabriel Grand , Ashwinee Panda , Maheep Chaudhary
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07482](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07482)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models require substantial computational resources for inference, posing deployment challenges. While dynamic pruning offers superior efficiency over static methods through adaptive circuit selection, it exacerbates alignment degradation by retaining only input-dependent safety-critical circuit preservation across diverse inputs. As a result, addressing these heightened alignment vulnerabilities remains critical. We introduce Alignment-Aware Probe Pruning (AAPP), a dynamic structured pruning method that adaptively preserves alignment-relevant circuits during inference, building upon Probe Pruning. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12B-IT show AAPP improves refusal rates by 50\% at matched compute, enabling efficient yet safety-preserving LLM deployment.

## 86. KG-DF: A Black-box Defense Framework against Jailbreak Attacks Based on Knowledge Graphs
- **Authors**: Shuyuan Liu , Jiawei Chen , Xiao Yang , Hang Su , Zhaoxia Yin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07480](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07480)
- **Abstract**:
> With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in various fields, the security challenges they face have become increasingly prominent, especially the issue of jailbreak. These attacks induce the model to generate erroneous or uncontrolled outputs through crafted inputs, threatening the generality and security of the model. Although existing defense methods have shown some effectiveness, they often struggle to strike a balance between model generality and security. Excessive defense may limit the normal use of the model, while insufficient defense may lead to security vulnerabilities. In response to this problem, we propose a Knowledge Graph Defense Framework (KG-DF). Specifically, because of its structured knowledge representation and semantic association capabilities, Knowledge Graph(KG) can be searched by associating input content with safe knowledge in the knowledge base, thus identifying potentially harmful intentions and providing safe reasoning paths. However, traditional KG methods encounter significant challenges in keyword extraction, particularly when confronted with diverse and evolving attack strategies. To address this issue, we introduce an extensible semantic parsing module, whose core task is to transform the input query into a set of structured and secure concept representations, thereby enhancing the relevance of the matching process. Experimental results show that our framework enhances defense performance against various jailbreak attack methods, while also improving the response quality of the LLM in general QA scenarios by incorporating domain-general knowledge.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07477](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07477)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models exhibit a peculiar epistemic pathology: they speak as if they know, even when they do not. This paper argues that such confident fabrication, what I call the polite liar, is a structural consequence of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Building on Frankfurt's analysis of bullshit as communicative indifference to truth, I show that this pathology is not deception but structural indifference: a reward architecture that optimizes for perceived sincerity over evidential accuracy. Current alignment methods reward models for being helpful, harmless, and polite, but not for being epistemically grounded. As a result, systems learn to maximize user satisfaction rather than truth, performing conversational fluency as a virtue. I analyze this behavior through the lenses of epistemic virtue theory, speech-act philosophy, and cognitive alignment, showing that RLHF produces agents trained to mimic epistemic confidence without access to epistemic justification. The polite liar thus reveals a deeper alignment tension between linguistic cooperation and epistemic integrity. The paper concludes with an "epistemic alignment" principle: reward justified confidence over perceived fluency.

- **Abstract**:
> We introduce Motif-2-12.7B, a new open-weight foundation model that pushes the efficiency frontier of large language models by combining architectural innovation with system-level optimization. Designed for scalable language understanding and robust instruction generalization under constrained compute budgets, Motif-2-12.7B builds upon Motif-2.6B with the integration of Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), which improves representational efficiency by disentangling signal and noise-control attention pathways. The model is pre-trained on 5.5 trillion tokens spanning diverse linguistic, mathematical, scientific, and programming domains using a curriculum-driven data scheduler that gradually changes the data composition ratio. The training system leverages the MuonClip optimizer alongside custom high-performance kernels, including fused PolyNorm activations and the Parallel Muon algorithm, yielding significant throughput and memory efficiency gains in large-scale distributed environments. Post-training employs a three-stage supervised fine-tuning pipeline that successively enhances general instruction adherence, compositional understanding, and linguistic precision. Motif-2-12.7B demonstrates competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, showing that thoughtful architectural scaling and optimized training design can rival the capabilities of much larger models.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07463](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07463)
- **Abstract**:
> Current evaluations of LLMs for code generation emphasize functional correctness, overlooking the fact that functionally correct solutions can differ significantly in algorithmic complexity. For instance, an $(O(n^2))$ versus $(O(n \log n))$ sorting algorithm may yield similar output but incur vastly different performance costs in production. This discrepancy reveals a critical limitation in current evaluation methods: they fail to capture the behavioral and performance diversity among correct solutions. To address this, we introduce a principled framework for evaluating the dynamic stability of generated code. We propose two metrics derived from opcode distributions: Static Canonical Trace Divergence (SCTD), which captures algorithmic structure diversity across generated solutions, and Dynamic Canonical Trace Divergence (DCTD), which quantifies runtime behavioral variance. Their ratio, the Behavioral Expression Factor (BEF), serves as a diagnostic signal: it indicates critical runtime instability when BEF $\ll$ 1 and functional redundancy when BEF $\gg$ 1. Empirical results on BigOBench and CodeContests show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant algorithmic variance even among functionally correct outputs. Notably, increasing sampling temperature improves pass@1 rates but degrades stability, revealing an unrecognized trade-off: searching for correct solutions in diverse output spaces introduces a "penalty of instability" between correctness and behavioral consistency. Our findings call for stability-aware objectives in code generation and new benchmarks with asymptotic test cases for robust, real-world LLM evaluation.

## 90. It Takes Two: A Dual Stage Approach for Terminology-Aware Translation
- **Authors**: Akshat Singh Jaswal
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07461)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper introduces DuTerm, a novel two-stage architecture for terminology-constrained machine translation. Our system combines a terminology-aware NMT model, adapted via fine-tuning on large-scale synthetic data, with a prompt-based LLM for post-editing. The LLM stage refines NMT output and enforces terminology adherence. We evaluate DuTerm on English-to German, English-to-Spanish, and English-to-Russian with the WMT 2025 Terminology Shared Task corpus. We demonstrate that flexible, context-driven terminology handling by the LLM consistently yields higher quality translations than strict constraint enforcement. Our results highlight a critical trade-off, revealing that an LLM's work best for high-quality translation as context-driven mutators rather than generators.

## 91. REFLEX: Reference-Free Evaluation of Log Summarization via Large Language Model Judgment
- **Authors**: Priyanka Mudgal
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07458](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07458)
- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating log summarization systems is challenging due to the lack of high-quality reference summaries and the limitations of existing metrics like ROUGE and BLEU, which depend on surface-level lexical overlap. We introduce REFLEX, a reference-free evaluation metric for log summarization based on large language model (LLM) judgment. REFLEX uses LLMs as zero-shot evaluators to assess summary quality along dimensions such as relevance, informativeness, and coherence, without requiring gold-standard references or human annotations. We show that REFLEX produces stable, interpretable, and fine-grained evaluations across multiple log summarization dataset, and more effectively distinguishes model outputs than traditional metrics. REFLEX provides a scalable alternative for evaluating log summaries in real-world settings where reference data is scarce or unavailable.

## 92. GRIP: In-Parameter Graph Reasoning through Fine-Tuning Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Jiarui Feng , Donghong Cai , Yixin Chen , Muhan Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07457](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07457)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling sequential textual data and generalizing across diverse tasks. However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

## 94. Pinching Antennas Meet AI in Next-Generation Wireless Networks
- **Authors**: Fang Fang , Zhiguo Ding , Victor C. M. Leung , Lajos Hanzo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07442](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07442)
- **Abstract**:
> Next-generation (NG) wireless networks must embrace innate intelligence in support of demanding emerging applications, such as extended reality and autonomous systems, under ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements. Pinching antennas (PAs), a new flexible low-cost technology, can create line-of-sight links by dynamically activating small dielectric pinches along a waveguide on demand. As a compelling complement, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the intelligence needed to manage the complex control of PA activation positions and resource allocation in these dynamic environments. This article explores the "win-win" cooperation between AI and PAs: AI facilitates the adaptive optimization of PA activation positions along the waveguide, while PAs support edge AI tasks such as federated learning and over-the-air aggregation. We also discuss promising research directions including large language model-driven PA control frameworks, and how PA-AI integration can advance semantic communications, and integrated sensing and communication. This synergy paves the way for adaptive, resilient, and self-optimizing NG networks.

## 95. AudAgent: Automated Auditing of Privacy Policy Compliance in AI Agents
- **Authors**: Ye Zheng , Yidan Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07441](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07441)
- **Abstract**:
> AI agents can autonomously perform tasks and, often without explicit user consent, collect or disclose users' sensitive local data, which raises serious privacy concerns. Although AI agents' privacy policies may describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual framework that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance with stated privacy policies. AudAgent consists of four components for automated privacy auditing of AI agents. (i) Policy parsing: an ensemble of LLMs translates natural-language privacy policies into a structured privacy-policy model, where cross-LLM voting guarantees confidence of the parsing results. (ii) Runtime annotation: a lightweight Presidio-based analyzer detects sensitive data and annotates how the data is used based on the context of the AI agent's operations and the privacy-policy model. (iii) Compliance auditing: ontology alignment and automata-based evaluation connect the policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checks between the natural-language policy and observed unordered data practices of AI agents. (iv) User interface: a platform-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy risks detected during auditing, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability. In addition to common formatted privacy policies, AudAgent also supports user-defined policies for fine-grained control and customization. We evaluate AudAgent on AI agents built upon mainstream programming frameworks such as AutoGen, experiments show that AudAgent effectively identifies potential privacy policy violations in real time.

## 96. Knowledge-Guided Textual Reasoning for Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via LLMs
- **Authors**: Hari Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07429](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07429)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce Text-based Explainable Video Anomaly Detection (TbVAD), a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs anomaly detection and explanation entirely within the textual domain. Unlike conventional WSVAD models that rely on explicit visual features, TbVAD represents video semantics through language, enabling interpretable and knowledge-grounded reasoning. The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. We evaluate TbVAD on two public benchmarks, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

## 97. DynaKV: Enabling Accurate and Efficient Long-Sequence LLM Decoding on Smartphones
- **Authors**: Tuowei Wang , Minxing Huang , Fengzu Li , Ligeng Chen , Jinrui Zhang , Ju Ren
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07427](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07427)
- **Abstract**:
> As the demand for human-like reasoning, multi-turn dialogues, and long-form responses grows, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to support efficient and effective long-sequence decoding. However, due to limited DRAM capacity, long-seuqence LLM decoding on smartphones is constrained by the key-value cache (KVCache), whose memory footprint increases linearly with sequence length. Retrieval-based methods mitigate DRAM pressure by offloading KVCache to flash and retrieving query-relevant entries through cluster-based indexing. Unfortunately, as decoding progresses, KVCache distribution shifts render static or local cluster updates progressively misaligned, excluding essential entries or fetching redundant ones. These issues are further exacerbated by smartphone-specific limitations in bandwidth, IOPS, and memory capacity. We propose DynaKV, the first adaptive KVCache management approach that jointly addresses accuracy and efficiency for long-sequence decoding on smartphones. DynaKV integrates three key techniques: (1) Migration-Free Cluster Adaptation, which adaptively splits clusters during retrieval without incurring additional transfers; (2) Continuity-Centric Flash Management, which co-locates correlated entries and clusters and employs a dual-head layout for efficient updates; and (3) Memory-Efficient Cache Design, which virtualizes cache space across DRAM and flash and extends replacement policies to align with cluster-level access patterns. Evaluations demonstrate that DynaKV improves retrieval accuracy and reduces end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, achieving average gains of $1.38\times$ in accuracy and $1.47\times$ speedups. Furthermore, the insights of DynaKV naturally extend to other long-context workloads and multi-tier memory hierarchies, underscoring its broader applicability.

## 98. Network and Systems Performance Characterization of MCP-Enabled LLM Agents
- **Authors**: Zihao Ding , Mufeng Zhu , Yao Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07426](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07426)
- **Abstract**:
> Model Context Protocol (MCP) has recently gained increased attention within the AI community for providing a standardized way for large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and services, significantly enhancing their capabilities. However, the inclusion of extensive contextual information, including system prompts, MCP tool definitions, and context histories, in MCP-enabled LLM interactions, dramatically inflates token usage. Given that LLM providers charge based on tokens, these expanded contexts can quickly escalate monetary costs and increase the computational load on LLM services. This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based analysis of MCP-enabled interactions with LLMs, revealing trade-offs between capability, performance, and cost. We explore how different LLM models and MCP configurations impact key performance metrics such as token efficiency, monetary cost, task completion times, and task success rates, and suggest potential optimizations, including enabling parallel tool calls and implementing robust task abort mechanisms. These findings provide useful insights for developing more efficient, robust, and cost-effective MCP-enabled workflows.

## 99. An Evaluation of LLMs Inference on Popular Single-board Computers
- **Authors**: Tung (Thomas) Nguyen , Tuyen Nguyen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07425](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07425)
- **Abstract**:
> The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference is driving interest in deploying lightweight, cost-effective AI solutions on edge hardware. Single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi and Orange Pi offer a promising platform for localized, privacy-preserving inference-but remain underexplored in the context of LLM workloads. In this work, we benchmark the performance of 25 quantized open-source LLMs across three SBCs-Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 5, and Orange Pi 5 Pro-using two inference runtimes: Ollama and Llamafile. We evaluate generation throughput, memory usage, and power consumption under varying CPU configurations, using multiple prompt types to simulate realistic workloads. Our results show that SBCs can reliably support models up to 1.5B parameters, with Llamafile achieving up to 4x higher throughput and 30-40% lower power usage than Ollama. We identify architecture-specific bottlenecks, highlight runtime-level trade-offs, and provide practical deployment recommendations. This study offers the first broad evaluation of LLM inference on SBCs, bridging the gap between high-performance language models and affordable edge computing.

- **Authors**: Genglin Wang , Liekang Zeng , Bufang Yang , Kaiwei Liu , Guoliang Xing , Chumin Sun , Li Zhou , Jie Sun , Zhenyu Yan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07423](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07423)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming key components in various mobile operating systems, driving smart applications like interactive chatbots and personal assistants. While bringing enhanced intelligence to mobile ends, their deployment suffers from a set of performance challenges, especially the generation quality degradation and prolonged latency. Prior works have mainly relied on solutions of cloud offloading or on-device Small Language Models (SLMs). However, the former is usually limited by the communication bottleneck, and the latter sacrifices generation quality due to resource constraints. To mitigate these limitations, this paper proposes Synera, a device-cloud synergistic LLM serving system that applies an efficient SLM-LLM synergistic mechanism. Through empirical studies on LLM's unique computing characteristics, Synera identifies a set of underexplored optimization opportunities in device-cloud synergistic LLM inference, including offloading decisions, pipeline stalls, and batching bottlenecks. To translate them into enhanced performance, Synera introduces tailored designs of communication-efficient selective offloading, stall-free parallel inference, and scalable cloud batching. Extensive evaluations with real-world testbeds show that Synera enables 1.20-5.47x better generation quality against competitive baselines with on-par latency performance. Compared with existing cloud serving, Synera achieves 8.2-16.5% lower cloud serving cost on various benchmarks.

## 101. Advancing mathematics research with large language models
- **Authors**: Lisa Carbone
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07420](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07420)
- **Abstract**:
> The main drawback of using generative AI models for advanced mathematics is that these models are not logical reasoning engines. However, Large Language Models, and their refinements, can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of generative AI models to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how generative AI models can be used to advance mathematics research. We also discuss their integration with Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.
