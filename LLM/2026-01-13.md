- **Abstract**:
> In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

- **Abstract**:
> Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field. The source code is publicly available on GitHub( this https URL ).

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05890](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05890)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-agent systems based on large language models, particularly centralized architectures, have recently shown strong potential for complex and knowledge-intensive tasks. However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

## 4. From Off-Policy to On-Policy: Enhancing GUI Agents via Bi-level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation
- **Authors**: Zezhou Wang , Ziyun Zhang , Xiaoyi Zhang , Zhuzhong Qian , Yan Lu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05787](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05787)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

## 5. DynaDebate: Breaking Homogeneity in Multi-Agent Debate with Dynamic Path Generation
- **Authors**: Zhenghao Li , Zhi Zheng , Wei Chen , Jielun Zhao , Yong Chen , Tong Xu , Enhong Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05746)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

## 6. PII-VisBench: Evaluating Personally Identifiable Information Safety in Vision Language Models Along a Continuum of Visibility
- **Authors**: G M Shahariar , Zabir Al Nazi , Md Olid Hasan Bhuiyan , Zhouxing Shi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05739](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05739)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

## 7. Logic-Parametric Neuro-Symbolic NLI: Controlling Logical Formalisms for Verifiable LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Ali Farjami , Luca Redondi , Marco Valentino
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05705](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05705)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

## 8. HAG: Hierarchical Demographic Tree-based Agent Generation for Topic-Adaptive Simulation
- **Authors**: Rongxin Chen , Tianyu Wu , Bingbing Xu , Xiucheng Xu , Huawei Shen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05656](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05656)
- **Abstract**:
> High-fidelity agent initialization is crucial for credible Agent-Based Modeling across diverse domains. A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

## 9. GenCtrl -- A Formal Controllability Toolkit for Generative Models
- **Authors**: Emily Cheng , Carmen Amo Alonso , Federico Danieli , Arno Blaas , Luca Zappella , Pau Rodriguez , Xavier Suau
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05637](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05637)
- **Abstract**:
> As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

## 10. Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models for Interpretable Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Authors**: Cooper Lin , Yanting Zhang , Maohao Ran , Wei Xue , Hongwei Fan , Yibo Xu , Zhenglin Wan , Sirui Han , Yike Guo , Jun Song
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05578](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05578)
- **Abstract**:
> E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

## 11. Crisis-Bench: Benchmarking Strategic Ambiguity and Reputation Management in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Cooper Lin , Maohao Ran , Yanting Zhang , Zhenglin Wan , Hongwei Fan , Yibo Xu , Yike Guo , Wei Xue , Jun Song
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05570](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05570)
- **Abstract**:
> Standard safety alignment optimizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for universal helpfulness and honesty, effectively instilling a rigid "Boy Scout" morality. While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a "transparency tax" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price. Crisis-Bench provides the first quantitative framework for assessing "Reputation Management" capabilities, arguing for a shift from rigid moral absolutism to context-aware professional alignment.

## 12. WildSci: Advancing Scientific Reasoning from In-the-Wild Literature
- **Authors**: Tengxiao Liu , Deepak Nathani , Zekun Li , Kevin Yang , William Yang Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05567)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning has focused on domains like mathematics and coding, where abundant high-quality data and objective evaluation metrics are readily available. In contrast, progress in LLM reasoning models remains limited in scientific domains such as medicine and materials science due to limited dataset coverage and the inherent complexity of open-ended scientific questions. To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach. We release WildSci to enable scalable and sustainable research in scientific reasoning, available at this https URL .

## 13. Safety Not Found (404): Hidden Risks of LLM-Based Robotics Decision Making
- **Authors**: Jua Han , Jaeyoon Seo , Jungbin Min , Jean Oh , Jihie Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05529](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05529)
- **Abstract**:
> One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

## 14. The Evaluation Gap in Medicine, AI and LLMs: Navigating Elusive Ground Truth & Uncertainty via a Probabilistic Paradigm
- **Authors**: Aparna Elangovan , Lei Xu , Mahsa Elyasi , Ismail Akdulum , Mehmet Aksakal , Enes Gurun , Brian Hur , Saab Mansour , Ravid Shwartz Ziv , Karin Verspoor , Dan Roth
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05500](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05500)
- **Abstract**:
> Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability. Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.

## 15. MMUEChange: A Generalized LLM Agent Framework for Intelligent Multi-Modal Urban Environment Change Analysis
- **Authors**: Zixuan Xiao , Jun Ma , Siwei Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05483](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05483)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding urban environment change is essential for sustainable development. However, current approaches, particularly remote sensing change detection, often rely on rigid, single-modal analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose MMUEChange, a multi-modal agent framework that flexibly integrates heterogeneous urban data via a modular toolkit and a core module, Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling robust analysis of complex urban change scenarios. Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste. Compared to the best-performing baseline, the MMUEChange agent achieves a 46.7% improvement in task success rate and effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating its capacity to support complex urban change analysis tasks with real-world policy implications.

## 16. ART: Adaptive Reasoning Trees for Explainable Claim Verification
- **Authors**: Sahil Wadhwa , Himanshu Kumar , Guanqun Yang , Abbaas Alif Mohamed Nishar , Pranab Mohanty , Swapnil Shinde , Yue Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05455](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05455)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful candidates for complex decision-making, leveraging vast encoded knowledge and remarkable zero-shot abilities. However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies. Our findings show that ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification which is more reliable and ensures clarity in the overall decision making step.

## 17. Conformity and Social Impact on AI Agents
- **Authors**: Alessandro Bellina , Giordano De Marzo , David Garcia
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05384](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05384)
- **Abstract**:
> As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting the dynamics of artificial societies. This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

## 18. The Persona Paradox: Medical Personas as Behavioral Priors in Clinical Language Models
- **Authors**: Tassallah Abdullahi , Shrestha Ghosh , Hamish S Fraser , Daniel León Tramontini , Adeel Abbasi , Ghada Bourjeily , Carsten Eickhoff , Ritambhara Singh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05376](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05376)
- **Abstract**:
> Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $\kappa = 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise. The code is available at this https URL \_Paradox.

## 19. Effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in Large Language Model agents
- **Authors**: Mizuki Sakai , Mizuki Yokoyama , Wakaba Tateishi , Genki Ichinose
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05302)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents in strategic and social interactions. Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.

## 20. Mathematical Knowledge Graph-Driven Framework for Equation-Based Predictive and Reliable Additive Manufacturing
- **Authors**: Yeongbin Cha , Namjung Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05298](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05298)
- **Abstract**:
> Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

- **Authors**: Eirini Baltzi , Tilemachos Moumouris , Athena Psalta , Vasileios Tsironis , Konstantinos Karantzalos
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05256)
- **Abstract**:
> Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

- **Authors**: Chengming Cui , Tianxin Wei , Ziyi Chen , Ruizhong Qiu , Zhichen Zeng , Zhining Liu , Xuying Ning , Duo Zhou , Jingrui He
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06022)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06002](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06002)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning from human or non-Long-CoT LLMs imitation. To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training. Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.

## 24. Agentic LLMs as Powerful Deanonymizers: Re-identification of Participants in the Anthropic Interviewer Dataset
- **Authors**: Tianshi Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05918](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05918)
- **Abstract**:
> On December 4, 2025, Anthropic released Anthropic Interviewer, an AI tool for running qualitative interviews at scale, along with a public dataset of 1,250 interviews with professionals, including 125 scientists, about their use of AI for research. Focusing on the scientist subset, I show that widely available LLMs with web search and agentic capabilities can link six out of twenty-four interviews to specific scientific works, recovering associated authors and, in some cases, uniquely identifying the interviewees. My contribution is to show that modern LLM-based agents make such re-identification attacks easy and low-effort: off-the-shelf tools can, with a few natural-language prompts, search the web, cross-reference details, and propose likely matches, effectively lowering the technical barrier. Existing safeguards can be bypassed by breaking down the re-identification into benign tasks. I outline the attack at a high level, discuss implications for releasing rich qualitative data in the age of LLM agents, and propose mitigation recommendations and open problems. I have notified Anthropic of my findings.

## 25. Illusions of Confidence? Diagnosing LLM Truthfulness via Neighborhood Consistency
- **Authors**: Haoming Xu , Ningyuan Zhao , Yunzhi Yao , Weihong Xu , Hongru Wang , Xinle Deng , Shumin Deng , Jeff Z. Pan , Huajun Chen , Ningyu Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05905](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05905)
- **Abstract**:
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings, correctness alone is insufficient. Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%. Code will be available at this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05904](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05904)
- **Abstract**:
> The strength of democracy lies in the free and equal exchange of diverse viewpoints. Living up to this ideal at scale faces inherent tensions: broad participation, meaningful deliberation, and political equality often trade off with one another (Fishkin, 2011). We ask whether and how artificial intelligence (AI) could help navigate this "trilemma" by engaging with a recent example of a large language model (LLM)-based system designed to help people with diverse viewpoints find common ground (Tessler, Bakker, et al., 2024). Here, we explore the implications of the introduction of LLMs into deliberation augmentation tools, examining their potential to enhance participation through scalability, improve political equality via fair mediation, and foster meaningful deliberation by, for example, surfacing trustworthy information. We also point to key challenges that remain. Ultimately, a range of empirical, technical, and theoretical advancements are needed to fully realize the promise of AI-mediated deliberation for enhancing citizen engagement and strengthening democratic deliberation.

## 27. An Empirical Study on Preference Tuning Generalization and Diversity Under Domain Shift
- **Authors**: Constantinos Karouzos , Xingwei Tan , Nikolaos Aletras
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05882](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05882)
- **Abstract**:
> Preference tuning aligns pretrained language models to human judgments of quality, helpfulness, or safety by optimizing over explicit preference signals rather than likelihood alone. Prior work has shown that preference-tuning degrades performance and reduces helpfulness when evaluated outside the training domain. However, the extent to which adaptation strategies mitigate this domain shift remains unexplored. We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. Our findings reveal systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift. We show that adaptation strategies based on pseudo-labeling can substantially reduce domain-shift degradation

## 28. Gender Bias in LLMs: Preliminary Evidence from Shared Parenting Scenario in Czech Family Law
- **Authors**: Jakub Harasta , Matej Vasina , Martin Kornel , Tomas Foltynek
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05879](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05879)
- **Abstract**:
> Access to justice remains limited for many people, leading laypersons to increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal self-help. Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts. We present exploratory and descriptive evidence intended to identify systematic asymmetries rather than to establish causal effects.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05874](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05874)
- **Abstract**:
> Modelling a language model for a multi-lingual scenario includes several potential challenges, among which catastrophic forgetting is the major challenge. For example, small language models (SLM) built for low-resource languages by adapting large language models (LLMs) pose the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. This work proposes to employ a continual learning strategy using parts-of-speech (POS)-based code-switching along with a replay adapter strategy to mitigate the identified gap of catastrophic forgetting while training SLM from LLM. Experiments conducted on vision language tasks such as visual question answering and language modelling task exhibits the success of the proposed architecture.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05870](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05870)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning have been hindered by a persistent challenge: exploration collapse. The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.

- **Authors**: Alexandra Dragomir , Florin Brad , Radu Tudor Ionescu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05858](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05858)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance in zero-shot multilingual machine translation (MT). Some follow-up works further improved MT performance via preference optimization, but they leave a key aspect largely underexplored: the order in which data samples are given during training. We address this topic by integrating curriculum learning into various state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms to boost MT performance. We introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy with restarts (CLewR), which reiterates easy-to-hard curriculum multiple times during training to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of easy examples. We demonstrate consistent gains across several model families (Gemma2, Qwen2.5, Llama3.1) and preference optimization techniques. We publicly release our code at this https URL .

## 32. Router-Suggest: Dynamic Routing for Multimodal Auto-Completion in Visually-Grounded Dialogs
- **Authors**: Sandeep Mishra , Devichand Budagam , Anubhab Mandal , Bishal Santra , Pawan Goyal , Manish Gupta
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05851](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05851)
- **Abstract**:
> Real-time multimodal auto-completion is essential for digital assistants, chatbots, design tools, and healthcare consultations, where user inputs rely on shared visual context. We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05825)
- **Abstract**:
> Passive brain-computer interfaces offer a potential source of implicit feedback for alignment of large language models, but most mental state decoding has been done in controlled tasks. This paper investigates whether established EEG classifiers for mental workload and implicit agreement can be transferred to spoken human-AI dialogue. We introduce two conversational paradigms - a Spelling Bee task and a sentence completion task- and an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing, annotating, and aligning word-level conversational events with continuous EEG classifier output. In a pilot study, workload decoding showed interpretable trends during spoken interaction, supporting cross-paradigm transfer. For implicit agreement, we demonstrate continuous application and precise temporal alignment to conversational events, while identifying limitations related to construct transfer and asynchronous application of event-based classifiers. Overall, the results establish feasibility and constraints for integrating passive BCI signals into conversational AI systems.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05810](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05810)
- **Abstract**:
> The ability to automatically generate large-scale, interactive, and physically realistic 3D environments is crucial for advancing robotic learning and embodied intelligence. However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates structurally valid, semantically coherent, and functionally interactive environments across diverse scene types and conditions, enabling scalable embodied AI research.

## 35. EnvScaler: Scaling Tool-Interactive Environments for LLM Agent via Programmatic Synthesis
- **Authors**: Xiaoshuai Song , Haofei Chang , Guanting Dong , Yutao Zhu , Zhicheng Dou , Ji-Rong Wen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05808](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05808)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are expected to be trained to act as agents in various real-world environments, but this process relies on rich and varied tool-interaction sandboxes. However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions. We release our code and data at this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05792](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05792)
- **Abstract**:
> Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is essential for computational drug discovery, yet existing models often rely on single-modality predefined molecular descriptors or sequence-based embeddings with limited representativeness. We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.

## 37. VIGIL: Defending LLM Agents Against Tool Stream Injection via Verify-Before-Commit
- **Authors**: Junda Lin , Zhaomeng Zhou , Zhi Zheng , Shuochen Liu , Tong Xu , Yong Chen , Enhong Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05755](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05755)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM agents operating in open environments face escalating risks from indirect prompt injection, particularly within the tool stream where manipulated metadata and runtime feedback hijack execution flow. Existing defenses encounter a critical dilemma as advanced models prioritize injected rules due to strict alignment while static protection mechanisms sever the feedback loop required for adaptive reasoning. To reconcile this conflict, we propose \textbf{VIGIL}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from restrictive isolation to a verify-before-commit protocol. By facilitating speculative hypothesis generation and enforcing safety through intent-grounded verification, \textbf{VIGIL} preserves reasoning flexibility while ensuring robust control. We further introduce \textbf{SIREN}, a benchmark comprising 959 tool stream injection cases designed to simulate pervasive threats characterized by dynamic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{VIGIL} outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic defenses by reducing the attack success rate by over 22\% while more than doubling the utility under attack compared to static baselines, thereby achieving an optimal balance between security and utility.

## 38. Analysing Differences in Persuasive Language in LLM-Generated Text: Uncovering Stereotypical Gender Patterns
- **Authors**: Amalie Brogaard Pauli , Maria Barrett , Max Müller-Eberstein , Isabelle Augenstein , Ira Assent
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05751)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for everyday communication tasks, including drafting interpersonal messages intended to influence and persuade. Prior work has shown that LLMs can successfully persuade humans and amplify persuasive language. It is therefore essential to understand how user instructions affect the generation of persuasive language, and to understand whether the generated persuasive language differs, for example, when targeting different groups. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science. Our results reveal significant gender differences in the persuasive language generated across all models. These patterns reflect biases consistent with gender-stereotypical linguistic tendencies documented in social psychology and sociolinguistics.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05742](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05742)
- **Abstract**:
> The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a new generation of powerful chatbots that can be developed at relatively low cost. As companies deploy these tools, security challenges need to be addressed to prevent financial loss and reputational damage. A key security challenge is jailbreaking, the malicious manipulation of prompts and inputs to bypass a chatbot's safety guardrails. Multi-turn attacks are a relatively new form of jailbreaking involving a carefully crafted chain of interactions with a chatbot. We introduce Echo Chamber, a new multi-turn attack using a gradual escalation method. We describe this attack in detail, compare it to other multi-turn attacks, and demonstrate its performance against multiple state-of-the-art models through extensive evaluation.

## 40. Visualising Information Flow in Word Embeddings with Diffusion Tensor Imaging
- **Authors**: Thomas Fabian
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05713](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05713)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent natural language is a central challenge in natural language processing (NLP) research. Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection. Our results show that our model permits novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending the comparison of isolated word embeddings and improving the interpretability of NLP models.

## 41. Multimodal In-context Learning for ASR of Low-resource Languages
- **Authors**: Zhaolin Li , Jan Niehues
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05707](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05707)
- **Abstract**:
> Automatic speech recognition (ASR) still covers only a small fraction of the world's languages, mainly due to supervised data scarcity. In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) addresses this problem, but prior work largely focuses on high-resource languages covered during training and text-only settings. This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data. Our code is publicly available.

- **Authors**: Haoran Wang , Xuanyi Zhang , Shuangsang Fang , Longke Ran , Ziqing Deng , Yong Zhang , Yuxiang Li , Shaoshuai Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05648](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05648)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advancements in single-cell multi-omics, particularly RNA-seq, have provided profound insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. While pre-trained language model (PLM) paradigm based single-cell foundation models have shown promise, they remain constrained by insufficient integration of in-depth individual profiles and neglecting the influence of noise within multi-modal data. To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model's resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.

- **Authors**: Jiawei Shen , Jia Zhu , Hanghui Guo , Weijie Shi , Yue Cui , Qingyu Niu , Guoqing Ma , Yidan Liang , Jingjiang Liu , Yiling Wang , Shimin Di , Jiajie Xu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05589](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05589)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-turn dialogue. However, in multi-turn dialogue, models still struggle to stay aligned with what has been established earlier, follow dependencies across many turns, and avoid drifting into incorrect facts as the interaction grows longer. Existing approaches primarily focus on extending the context window, introducing external memory, or applying context compression, yet these methods still face limitations such as \textbf{contextual inertia} and \textbf{state drift}. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}ontext \textbf{R}efactoring \textbf{(ACR)} Framework, which dynamically monitors and reshapes the interaction history to mitigate contextual inertia and state drift actively. ACR is built on a library of context refactoring operators and a teacher-guided self-evolving training paradigm that learns when to intervene and how to refactor, thereby decoupling context management from the reasoning process. Extensive experiments on multi-turn dialogue demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines while reducing token consumption.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05588](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05588)
- **Abstract**:
> Dual and cross encoders have long been mainstays of information retrieval (IR), but are being challenged by the emergent capabilities of LLMs. An LLM-based approach we term pointwise generative ranking - generating tokens the length of a single docID as opposed to a list in order to enable ranking via beam search - combines efficiency and expressivity benefits while leveraging the in-context capabilities of Causal Transformers. Although there is ample evidence to suggest that pretrained LLMs are well-suited for ranking, we find that the vast majority of LLM-based approaches rely on next-token prediction, a loss function which is fundamentally rank-agnostic (and especially so with pointwise supervision). In this paper, we first prove that the expressivity of pointwise generative ranking with multi-token docIDs is superior to that of dual encoders. We then propose SToICaL - a Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss - which can incorporate rank-aware supervision at both the item and token levels within the pointwise setup. We run a suite of experiments on ranking tasks derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and ESCI (Reddy et al., arXiv:2206.06588 ). Two variants of SToICaL successfully suppress the probability of invalid docID generations and improve on common ranking metrics beyond top-1 retrieval.

## 45. HogVul: Black-box Adversarial Code Generation Framework Against LM-based Vulnerability Detectors
- **Authors**: Jingxiao Yang , Ping He , Tianyu Du , Sun Bing , Xuhong Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05587](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05587)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in software vulnerability detection have been driven by Language Model (LM)-based approaches. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit lexical and syntax perturbations, allowing critical flaws to evade detection. Existing black-box attacks on LM-based vulnerability detectors primarily rely on isolated perturbation strategies, limiting their ability to efficiently explore the adversarial code space for optimal perturbations. To bridge this gap, we propose HogVul, a black-box adversarial code generation framework that integrates both lexical and syntax perturbations under a unified dual-channel optimization strategy driven by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By systematically coordinating two-level perturbations, HogVul effectively expands the search space for adversarial examples, enhancing the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HogVul achieves an average attack success rate improvement of 26.05\% over state-of-the-art baseline methods. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid optimization strategies in exposing model vulnerabilities.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05579](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05579)
- **Abstract**:
> Translating SQL dialects across different relational database management systems (RDBMSs) is crucial for migrating RDBMS-based applications to the cloud. Traditional SQL dialect translation tools rely on manually-crafted rules, necessitating significant manual effort to support new RDBMSs and dialects. Although large language models (LLMs) can assist in translating SQL dialects, they often struggle with lengthy and complex SQL queries. In this paper, we propose RISE, a novel LLM-based SQL dialect translation approach that can accurately handle lengthy and complex SQL queries. Given a complex source query $Q_c$ that contains a SQL dialect $d$, we first employ a dialect-aware query reduction technique to derive a simplified query $Q_{s}$ by removing $d$-irrelevant SQL elements from $Q_c$. Subsequently, we utilize LLMs to translate $Q_{s}$ into $Q_{s^{'}}$, and automatically extract the translation rule $r_d$ for dialect $d$ based on the relationship between $Q_{s}$ and $Q_{s^{'}}$. By applying $r_d$ to $Q_c$, we can effectively translate the dialect $d$ within $Q_c$, thereby bypassing the complexity of the source query $Q_c$. We evaluate RISE on two real-world benchmarks, i.e., TPC-DS and SQLProcBench, comparing its performance against both the traditional rule-based tools and the LLM-based approaches with respect to translation accuracy. RISE achieves accuracies of 97.98% on TPC-DS and 100% on SQLProcBench, outperforming the baselines by an average improvement of 24.62% and 238.41%, respectively.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05547](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05547)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, but remain susceptible to hallucinations, where generated text deviates from the underlying visual content. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful this http URL , directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05542](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05542)
- **Abstract**:
> Automated unit test generation aims to improve software quality while reducing the time and effort required for creating tests manually. However, existing techniques primarily generate regression oracles that predicate on the implemented behavior of the class under test. They do not address the oracle problem: the challenge of distinguishing correct from incorrect program behavior. With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts. This paper presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of LLMs in generating test oracles that expose software failures. We investigate how different prompting strategies and levels of contextual input impact the quality of LLM-generated oracles. Our findings offer insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based oracle generation in the FM era, improving our understanding of their capabilities and fostering future research in this area.

- **Abstract**:
> Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external retrieval. However, they often over-search -- unnecessarily invoking search tool even when it does not improve response quality, which leads to computational inefficiency and hallucinations by incorporating irrelevant context. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of over-searching across multiple dimensions, including query types, model categories, retrieval conditions, and multi-turn conversations. Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.

## 50. Evaluating the Use of LLMs for Automated DOM-Level Resolution of Web Performance Issues
- **Authors**: Gideon Peters , SayedHassan Khatoonabadi , Emad Shihab
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05502](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05502)
- **Abstract**:
> Users demand fast, seamless webpage experiences, yet developers often struggle to meet these expectations within tight constraints. Performance optimization, while critical, is a time-consuming and often manual process. One of the most complex tasks in this domain is modifying the Document Object Model (DOM), which is why this study focuses on it. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue to automate this complex task, potentially transforming how developers address web performance issues. This study evaluates the effectiveness of nine state-of-the-art LLMs for automated web performance issue resolution. For this purpose, we first extracted the DOM trees of 15 popular webpages (e.g., Facebook), and then we used Lighthouse to retrieve their performance audit reports. Subsequently, we passed the extracted DOM trees and corresponding audits to each model for resolution. Our study considers 7 unique audit categories, revealing that LLMs universally excel at SEO & Accessibility issues. However, their efficacy in performance-critical DOM manipulations is mixed. While high-performing models like GPT-4.1 delivered significant reductions in areas like Initial Load, Interactivity, and Network Optimization (e.g., 46.52% to 48.68% audit incidence reductions), others, such as GPT-4o-mini, notably underperformed, consistently. A further analysis of these modifications showed a predominant additive strategy and frequent positional changes, alongside regressions particularly impacting Visual Stability.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05467](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05467)
- **Abstract**:
> Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved major advances in reasoning, planning, and function-calling capabilities. Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.

## 52. Jailbreaking Large Language Models through Iterative Tool-Disguised Attacks via Reinforcement Learning

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05466)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse applications, however, they remain critically vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful responses violating human values and safety guidelines. Despite extensive research on defense mechanisms, existing safeguards prove insufficient against sophisticated adversarial strategies. In this work, we propose iMIST (\underline{i}nteractive \underline{M}ulti-step \underline{P}rogre\underline{s}sive \underline{T}ool-disguised Jailbreak Attack), a novel adaptive jailbreak method that synergistically exploits vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms. iMIST disguises malicious queries as normal tool invocations to bypass content filters, while simultaneously introducing an interactive progressive optimization algorithm that dynamically escalates response harmfulness through multi-turn dialogues guided by real-time harmfulness assessment. Our experiments on widely-used models demonstrate that iMIST achieves higher attack effectiveness, while maintaining low rejection rates. These results reveal critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety mechanisms and underscore the urgent need for more robust defense strategies.

## 53. Do LLMs Need Inherent Reasoning Before Reinforcement Learning? A Study in Korean Self-Correction
- **Authors**: Hongjin Kim , Jaewook Lee , Kiyoung Lee , Jong-hun Shin , Soojong Lim , Oh-Woog Kwon
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05459](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05459)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and self-correction abilities in high-resource languages like English, but their performance remains limited in low-resource languages such as Korean. In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities. Our study provides a new perspective on how internal translation and neuron-level tuning contribute to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05437](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05437)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) often produce human-like moral judgments, but it is unclear whether this reflects an internal conceptual structure or superficial ``moral mimicry.'' Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05432](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05432)
- **Abstract**:
> The image geolocalization task aims to predict the location where an image was taken anywhere on Earth using visual clues. Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\% to 22.1\% compared to \textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

## 56. Lost in Execution: On the Multilingual Robustness of Tool Calling in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Zheng Luo , T Pranav Kutralingam , Ogochukwu N Okoani , Wanpeng Xu , Hua Wei , Xiyang Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05366](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05366)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that invoke external tools through structured function calls. While recent work reports strong tool-calling performance under standard English-centric evaluations, the robustness of tool calling under multilingual user interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MLCL, a diagnostic benchmark, and conduct a systematic evaluation of multilingual tool calling across Chinese, Hindi, and the low-resource language Igbo. Through fine-grained error analysis, we show that many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions. We further evaluate several inference-time system strategies and find that while these strategies substantially reduce language-induced execution errors, none of them can fully recover English-level performance.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05339](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05339)
- **Abstract**:
> In recent years, the security vulnerabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become a serious concern in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) research. These highly intelligent models, capable of performing multi-modal tasks with high accuracy, are also severely susceptible to carefully launched security attacks, such as jailbreaking attacks, which can manipulate model behavior and bypass safety constraints. This paper introduces MJAD-MLLMs, a holistic framework that systematically analyzes the proposed Multi-turn Jailbreaking Attacks and multi-LLM-based defense techniques for MLLMs. In this paper, we make three original contributions. First, we introduce a novel multi-turn jailbreaking attack to exploit the vulnerabilities of the MLLMs under multi-turn prompting. Second, we propose a novel fragment-optimized and multi-LLM defense mechanism, called FragGuard, to effectively mitigate jailbreaking attacks in the MLLMs. Third, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks and defenses through extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and closed-source MLLMs and benchmark datasets, and compare their performance with the existing techniques.

## 58. On the Limits of Self-Improving in LLMs and Why AGI, ASI and the Singularity Are Not Near Without Symbolic Model Synthesis
- **Authors**: Hector Zenil
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05280](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05280)
- **Abstract**:
> We formalise recursive self-training in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI as a discrete-time dynamical system and prove that, as training data become increasingly self-generated ($\alpha_t \to 0$), the system undergoes inevitably degenerative dynamics. We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning. We conclude that while purely distributional learning leads to model collapse, hybrid neurosymbolic approaches offer a coherent framework for sustained self-improvement.

- **Abstract**:
> Industrial part specification extraction from unstructured text remains a persistent challenge in manufacturing, procurement, and maintenance, where manual processing is both time-consuming and error-prone. This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented multi-LLM ensemble framework that orchestrates nine state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) within a structured three-phase pipeline. RAGsemble addresses key limitations of single-model systems by combining the complementary strengths of model families including Gemini (2.0, 2.5, 1.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini), Mistral Large, and Gemma (1B, 4B, 3n-e4b), while grounding outputs in factual data using FAISS-based semantic retrieval. The system architecture consists of three stages: (1) parallel extraction by diverse LLMs, (2) targeted research augmentation leveraging high-performing models, and (3) intelligent synthesis with conflict resolution and confidence-aware scoring. RAG integration provides real-time access to structured part databases, enabling the system to validate, refine, and enrich outputs through similarity-based reference retrieval. Experimental results using real industrial datasets demonstrate significant gains in extraction accuracy, technical completeness, and structured output quality compared to leading single-LLM baselines. Key contributions include a scalable ensemble architecture for industrial domains, seamless RAG integration throughout the pipeline, comprehensive quality assessment mechanisms, and a production-ready solution suitable for deployment in knowledge-intensive manufacturing environments.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05264](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05264)
- **Abstract**:
> This article provides a comprehensive systematic literature review of academic studies, industrial applications, and real-world deployments from 2018 to 2025, providing a practical guide and detailed overview of modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures. RAG offers a modular approach for integrating external knowledge without increasing the capacity of the model as LLM systems expand. Research and engineering practices have been fragmented as a result of the increasing diversity of RAG methodologies, which encompasses a variety of fusion mechanisms, retrieval strategies, and orchestration approaches. We provide quantitative assessment frameworks, analyze the implications for trust and alignment, and systematically consolidate existing RAG techniques into a unified taxonomy. This document is a practical framework for the deployment of resilient, secure, and domain-adaptable RAG systems, synthesizing insights from academic literature, industry reports, and technical implementation guides. It also functions as a technical reference.

## 61. LLM2IR: simple unsupervised contrastive learning makes long-context LLM great retriever
- **Authors**: Xiaocong Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05262](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05262)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern dense information retrieval (IR) models usually rely on costly large-scale pretraining. In this paper, we introduce LLM2IR, an efficient unsupervised contrastive learning framework to convert any decoder-only large language model (LLM) to an information retrieval model. Despite its simplicity, the effectiveness is proven among different LLMs on multiple IR benchmarks including LoCo, LongEmbed and BEIR. We also find that models with a longer context length tend to have a stronger IR capacity by comparing task performances of models in the same model family. Our work not only provides an effective way to build IR models on the state-of-the-art LLMs, but also shed light on the relationship between information retrieval ability and model context length, which helps the design of better information retrievers.

## 62. Quantifying Document Impact in RAG-LLMs
- **Authors**: Armin Gerami , Kazem Faghih , Ramani Duraiswami
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05260](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05260)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by connecting them to external knowledge, improving accuracy and reducing outdated information. However, this introduces challenges such as factual inconsistencies, source conflicts, bias propagation, and security vulnerabilities, which undermine the trustworthiness of RAG systems. A key gap in current RAG evaluation is the lack of a metric to quantify the contribution of individual retrieved documents to the final output. To address this, we introduce the Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that measures the impact of each retrieved document on the generated response. We validate IS through two experiments. First, a poison attack simulation across three datasets demonstrates that IS correctly identifies the malicious document as the most influential in $86\%$ of cases. Second, an ablation study shows that a response generated using only the top-ranked documents by IS is consistently judged more similar to the original response than one generated from the remaining documents. These results confirm the efficacy of IS in isolating and quantifying document influence, offering a valuable tool for improving the transparency and reliability of RAG systems.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05258](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05258)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM-based conversational systems have become a popular gateway for information access, yet most existing chatbots struggle to handle news-related trending queries effectively. To improve user experience, an effective trending query detection method is urgently needed to enable differentiated processing of such target traffic. However, current research on trending detection tailored to the dialogue system scenario remains largely unexplored, and methods designed for traditional search engines often underperform in conversational contexts due to radically distinct query distributions and expression patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests, and user satisfaction is relatively improved by 27\% in terms of positive-negative feedback ratio.

## 64. KP-Agent: Keyword Pruning in Sponsored Search Advertising via LLM-Powered Contextual Bandits
- **Authors**: Hou-Wan Long , Yicheng Song , Zidong Wang , Tianshu Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05257](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05257)
- **Abstract**:
> Sponsored search advertising (SSA) requires advertisers to constantly adjust keyword strategies. While bid adjustment and keyword generation are well-studied, keyword pruning-refining keyword sets to enhance campaign performance-remains under-explored. This paper addresses critical inefficiencies in current practices as evidenced by a dataset containing 0.5 million SSA records from a pharmaceutical advertiser on search engine Meituan, China's largest delivery platform. We propose KP-Agent, an LLM agentic system with domain tool set and a memory module. By modeling keyword pruning within a contextual bandit framework, KP-Agent generates code snippets to refine keyword sets through reinforcement learning. Experiments show KP-Agent improves cumulative profit by up to 49.28% over baselines.

## 65. Tiny Recursive Models on ARC-AGI-1: Inductive Biases, Identity Conditioning, and Test-Time Compute
- **Authors**: Antonio Roye-Azar , Santiago Vargas-Naranjo , Dhruv Ghai , Nithin Balamurugan , Rayan Amir
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11847](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11847)
- **Abstract**:
> Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) were proposed as a parameter-efficient alternative to large language models for solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) style tasks. The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.

## 66. Automating Deception: Scalable Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreaks
- **Authors**: Adarsh Kumarappan , Ananya Mujoo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19517](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19517)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-turn conversational attacks, which leverage psychological principles like Foot-in-the-Door (FITD), where a small initial request paves the way for a more significant one, to bypass safety alignments, pose a persistent threat to Large Language Models (LLMs). Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.

- **Authors**: Chaofan Wang , Tingrui Yu , Chen Xie , Jie Wang , Dong Chen , Wenrui Zhang , Yuling Shi , Xiaodong Gu , Beijun Shen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295)
- **Abstract**:
> Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.
