- **Abstract**:
> AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.

- **Authors**: Ming Gu , Ziwei Wang , Sicen Lai , Zirui Gao , Sheng Zhou , Jiajun Bu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03471](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03471)
- **Abstract**:
> Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for advancing social welfare, justice, and equality in digital spaces, yet the vast majority of website user interfaces remain non-compliant, due in part to the resource-intensive and unscalable nature of current auditing practices. While WCAG-EM offers a structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work, we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks. Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.

## 3. From Five Dimensions to Many: Large Language Models as Precise and Interpretable Psychological Profilers
- **Authors**: Yi-Fei Liu , Yi-Long Lu , Di He , Hang Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03235)
- **Abstract**:
> Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 > 0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five responses into natural language personality summaries through information selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics. Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent, second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their emergent reasoning capabilities.

## 4. Toward Autonomous Engineering Design: A Knowledge-Guided Multi-Agent Framework
- **Authors**: Varun Kumar , George Em Karniadakis
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03179](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03179)
- **Abstract**:
> The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.

- **Authors**: Qi Li , Jianjun Xu , Pingtao Wei , Jiu Li , Peiqiang Zhao , Jiwei Shi , Xuan Zhang , Yanhui Yang , Xiaodong Hui , Peng Xu , Wenqin Shao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03138](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03138)
- **Abstract**:
> With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level, the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score, validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios. This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building high-security, high-trust LLM applications.

## 6. Using Multi-modal Large Language Model to Boost Fireworks Algorithm's Ability in Settling Challenging Optimization Tasks
- **Authors**: Shipeng Cen , Ying Tan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03137](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03137)
- **Abstract**:
> As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities. Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on many problem instances.

## 7. Large language models require a new form of oversight: capability-based monitoring
- **Authors**: Katherine C. Kellogg , Bingyang Ye , Yifan Hu , Guergana K. Savova , Byron Wallace , Danielle S. Bitterman
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03106](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03106)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches, inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses, long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss. We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach. Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist artificial intelligence models in healthcare.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03092](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03092)
- **Abstract**:
> The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.

## 9. Epidemiology of Large Language Models: A Benchmark for Observational Distribution Knowledge
- **Authors**: Drago Plecko , Patrik Okanovic , Torsten Hoefler , Elias Bareinboim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03070](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03070)
- **Abstract**:
> Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications. Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time, classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions, challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer 1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional (Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also limited.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03051](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03051)
- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as judges is increasingly critical for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines. We present ScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36 LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, across multiple product categories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent framework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels via scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM evaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item recommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, with actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.

## 11. PublicAgent: Multi-Agent Design Principles From an LLM-Based Open Data Analysis Framework
- **Authors**: Sina Montazeri , Yunhe Feng , Kewei Sha
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03023)
- **Abstract**:
> Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems. First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94% discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96% for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

## 12. Grounded Misunderstandings in Asymmetric Dialogue: A Perspectivist Annotation Scheme for MapTask
- **Authors**: Nan Li , Albert Gatt , Massimo Poesio
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03718](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03718)
- **Abstract**:
> Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing common ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while referring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression, enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating (V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative dialogue.

## 13. AnaFlow: Agentic LLM-based Workflow for Reasoning-Driven Explainable and Sample-Efficient Analog Circuit Sizing
- **Authors**: Mohsen Ahmadzadeh , Kaichang Chen , Georges Gielen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03697](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03697)
- **Abstract**:
> Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.

- **Authors**: Xingyao Wang , Simon Rosenberg , Juan Michelini , Calvin Smith , Hoang Tran , Engel Nyst , Rohit Malhotra , Xuhui Zhou , Valerie Chen , Robert Brennan , Graham Neubig
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03690](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03690)
- **Abstract**:
> Agents are now used widely in the process of software development, but building production-ready software engineering agents is a complex task. Deploying software agents effectively requires flexibility in implementation and experimentation, reliable and secure execution, and interfaces for users to interact with agents. In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent SDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these desiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent components of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents, which has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple interface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the default case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents with features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security and reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability, integrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can connect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS Code, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing SDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native sandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and built-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow the OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for prototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably deploying agents at scale.

## 15. Whisper Leak: a side-channel attack on Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Geoff McDonald , Jonathan Bar Or
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03675](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03675)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains including healthcare, legal services, and confidential communications, where privacy is paramount. This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like "money laundering" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle increasingly sensitive information.

## 16. Watermarking Large Language Models in Europe: Interpreting the AI Act in Light of Technology
- **Authors**: Thomas Souverain
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03641](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03641)
- **Abstract**:
> To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union, the AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their general-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods that are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet, the rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards can be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses this challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the multiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct concepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking Categorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods according to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before, during, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2) Watermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping each criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and detectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since interoperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we propose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking Comparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the operationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all four standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further research into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture of LLMs.

## 17. LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Haofei Yu , Fenghai Li , Jiaxuan You
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03628](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03628)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across benchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but these tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty. Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles: (i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1) high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and (3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence, motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency under live uncertainty.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03601](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03601)
- **Abstract**:
> We present Step-Audio-EditX, the first open-source LLM-based audio model excelling at expressive and iterative audio editing encompassing emotion, speaking style, and paralinguistics alongside robust zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) this http URL core innovation lies in leveraging only large-margin synthetic data, which circumvents the need for embedding-based priors or auxiliary modules. This large-margin learning approach enables both iterative control and high expressivity across voices, and represents a fundamental pivot from the conventional focus on representation-level disentanglement. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio-EditX surpasses both MiniMax-2.6-hd and Doubao-Seed-TTS-2.0 in emotion editing and other fine-grained control tasks.

- **Authors**: Andrei Ivanov , Siyuan Shen , Gioele Gottardo , Marcin Chrapek , Afif Boudaoud , Timo Schneider , Luca Benini , Torsten Hoefler
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03586](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03586)
- **Abstract**:
> The increasing complexity of machine learning models and the proliferation of diverse hardware architectures (CPUs, GPUs, accelerators) make achieving optimal performance a significant challenge. Heterogeneity in instruction sets, specialized kernel requirements for different data types and model features (e.g., sparsity, quantization), and architecture-specific optimizations complicate performance tuning. Manual optimization is resource-intensive, while existing automatic approaches often rely on complex hardware-specific heuristics and uninterpretable intermediate representations, hindering performance portability. We introduce PerfLLM, a novel automatic optimization methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Central to this is PerfDojo, an environment framing optimization as an RL game using a human-readable, mathematically-inspired code representation that guarantees semantic validity through transformations. This allows effective optimization without prior hardware knowledge, facilitating both human analysis and RL agent training. We demonstrate PerfLLM's ability to achieve significant performance gains across diverse CPU (x86, Arm, RISC-V) and GPU architectures.

## 20. AILA--First Experiments with Localist Language Models
- **Authors**: Joachim Diederich
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03559](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03559)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper presents the first empirical demonstration of controllable locality in transformer language models, a novel architectural framework that enables continuous control over the degree of representation localization through a tunable locality dial parameter. Unlike traditional language models that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\lambda} across the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower attention entropy, with {\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18 bits at {\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets. Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\lambda} = 0.6 achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability, offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design principles.

## 21. MultiZebraLogic: A Multilingual Logical Reasoning Benchmark
- **Authors**: Sofie Helene Bruun , Dan Saattrup Smart
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03553](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03553)
- **Abstract**:
> Measuring the full abilities of large language models (LLMs) requires benchmarks representing multiple tasks. We aim to create large, high-quality datasets for comparison of logical reasoning skills across several languages and of suitable difficulty for LLMs of various reasoning ability. We explore multiple ways of increasing difficulty. We generate zebra puzzles in multiple languages, themes, sizes and including 14 different clue types and 8 red herring types (uninformative clues). We find puzzle sizes 2x3 and 4x5 are sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (a non-reasoning model) and o3-mini (a reasoning model), respectively. Including 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini puzzle-level accuracy on 4x5 puzzles by 15$\pm$7 %. Scores of o3-mini on 4x5 puzzles are not significantly affected by use of English vs. Danish or the common houses theme vs. the country-specific smoerrebroed theme. We find no correlation between difficulty and the selected clue types. Datasets of 128+1024 puzzles are published as MultiZebraLogic in each of nine Germanic languages for sizes 2x3 and 4x5. We publish code for puzzle generation, designed for adaptablity into more languages and themes.

## 22. Uncovering Code Insights: Leveraging GitHub Artifacts for Deeper Code Understanding
- **Authors**: Ziv Nevo , Orna Raz , Karen Yorav
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03549)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding the purpose of source code is a critical task in software maintenance, onboarding, and modernization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating code explanations, they often lack grounding in the broader software engineering context. We propose a novel approach that leverages natural language artifacts from GitHub -- such as pull request descriptions, issue descriptions and discussions, and commit messages -- to enhance LLM-based code understanding. Our system consists of three components: one that extracts and structures relevant GitHub context, another that uses this context to generate high-level explanations of the code's purpose, and a third that validates the explanation. We implemented this as a standalone tool, as well as a server within the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling integration with other AI-assisted development tools. Our main use case is that of enhancing a standard LLM-based code explanation with code insights that our system generates. To evaluate explanations' quality, we conducted a small scale user study, with developers of several open projects, as well as developers of proprietary projects. Our user study indicates that when insights are generated they often are helpful and non trivial, and are free from hallucinations.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03542](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03542)
- **Abstract**:
> Medical question answering systems face deployment challenges including hallucinations, bias, computational demands, privacy concerns, and the need for specialized expertise across diverse domains. Here, we present SOLVE-Med, a multi-agent architecture combining domain-specialized small language models for complex medical queries. The system employs a Router Agent for dynamic specialist selection, ten specialized models (1B parameters each) fine-tuned on specific medical domains, and an Orchestrator Agent that synthesizes responses. Evaluated on Italian medical forum data across ten specialties, SOLVE-Med achieves superior performance with ROUGE-1 of 0.301 and BERTScore F1 of 0.697, outperforming standalone models up to 14B parameters while enabling local deployment. Our code is publicly available on GitHub: this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models. The code is available with a permissive license at this https URL .

## 25. CareMedEval dataset: Evaluating Critical Appraisal and Reasoning in the Biomedical Field
- **Authors**: Doria Bonzi , Alexandre Guiggi , Frédéric Béchet , Carlos Ramisch , Benoit Favre
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03441](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03441)
- **Abstract**:
> Critical appraisal of scientific literature is an essential skill in the biomedical field. While large language models (LLMs) can offer promising support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students, the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for critical appraisal.

## 26. Inter-Agent Trust Models: A Comparative Study of Brief, Claim, Proof, Stake, Reputation and Constraint in Agentic Web Protocol Design-A2A, AP2, ERC-8004, and Beyond
- **Authors**: Botao 'Amber' Hu , Helena Rong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03434](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03434)
- **Abstract**:
> As the "agentic web" takes shape-billions of AI agents (often LLM-powered) autonomously transacting and collaborating-trust shifts from human oversight to protocol design. In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 "Trustless Agents," yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g. AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we analyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular emphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection, sycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and misalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle. Our findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for trustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate high-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and Reputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively evaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic research under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social robustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid trust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM behavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable, and scalable agent economies.

## 27. Light over Heavy: Automated Performance Requirements Quantification with Linguistic Inducement
- **Authors**: Shihai Wang , Tao Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03421](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03421)
- **Abstract**:
> Elicited performance requirements need to be quantified for compliance in different engineering tasks, e.g., configuration tuning and performance testing. Much existing work has relied on manual quantification, which is expensive and error-prone due to the imprecision. In this paper, we present LQPR, a highly efficient automatic approach for performance requirements this http URL relies on a new theoretical framework that converts quantification as a classification problem. Despite the prevalent applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) for requirement analytics, LQPR takes a different perspective to address the classification: we observed that performance requirements can exhibit strong patterns and are often short/concise, therefore we design a lightweight linguistically induced matching mechanism. We compare LQPR against nine state-of-the-art learning-based approaches over diverse datasets, demonstrating that it is ranked as the sole best for 75% or more cases with two orders less cost. Our work proves that, at least for performance requirement quantification, specialized methods can be more suitable than the general LLM-driven approaches.

## 28. Computational Imaging Meets LLMs: Zero-Shot IDH Mutation Prediction in Brain Gliomas
- **Authors**: Syed Muqeem Mahmood , Hassan Mohy-ud-Din
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03376](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03376)
- **Abstract**:
> We present a framework that combines Large Language Models with computational image analytics for non-invasive, zero-shot prediction of IDH mutation status in brain gliomas. For each subject, coregistered multi-parametric MRI scans and multi-class tumor segmentation maps were processed to extract interpretable semantic (visual) attributes and quantitative features, serialized in a standardized JSON file, and used to query GPT 4o and GPT 5 without fine-tuning. We evaluated this framework on six publicly available datasets (N = 1427) and results showcased high accuracy and balanced classification performance across heterogeneous cohorts, even in the absence of manual annotations. GPT 5 outperformed GPT 4o in context-driven phenotype interpretation. Volumetric features emerged as the most important predictors, supplemented by subtype-specific imaging markers and clinical information. Our results demonstrate the potential of integrating LLM-based reasoning with computational image analytics for precise, non-invasive tumor genotyping, advancing diagnostic strategies in neuro-oncology.

## 29. Decoupling Augmentation Bias in Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Gahyeon Kim , Sohee Kim , Seokju Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03367](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03367)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors, known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations, particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03361](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03361)
- **Abstract**:
> In this work, we present a new state-of-the-art Romanian Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system based on NVIDIA's FastConformer architecture--explored here for the first time in the context of Romanian. We train our model on a large corpus of, mostly, weakly supervised transcriptions, totaling over 2,600 hours of speech. Leveraging a hybrid decoder with both Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Token-Duration Transducer (TDT) branches, we evaluate a range of decoding strategies including greedy, ALSD, and CTC beam search with a 6-gram token-level language model. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance across all Romanian evaluation benchmarks, including read, spontaneous, and domain-specific speech, with up to 27% relative WER reduction compared to previous best-performing systems. In addition to improved transcription accuracy, our approach demonstrates practical decoding efficiency, making it suitable for both research and deployment in low-latency ASR applications.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03328](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03328)
- **Abstract**:
> A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode") alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these "dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.

## 32. Comparing the Performance of LLMs in RAG-based Question-Answering: A Case Study in Computer Science Literature
- **Authors**: Ranul Dayarathne , Uvini Ranaweera , Upeksha Ganegoda
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03261](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03261)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination. Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini, alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.

## 33. Hybrid Fact-Checking that Integrates Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, and Search-Based Retrieval Agents Improves Interpretable Claim Verification
- **Authors**: Shaghayegh Kolli , Richard Rosenbaum , Timo Cavelius , Lasse Strothe , Andrii Lata , Jana Diesner
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03217](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03217)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating fluent utterances but can lack reliable grounding in verified information. At the same time, knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers deliver precise and interpretable evidence, yet suffer from limited coverage or latency. By integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs and real-time search agents, we introduce a hybrid fact-checking approach that leverages the individual strengths of each component. Our system comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid one - hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient. Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the Supported/Refuted split without task- specific fine - tuning. To address Not enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM reviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking pipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.

## 34. LGM: Enhancing Large Language Models with Conceptual Meta-Relations and Iterative Retrieval
- **Authors**: Wenchang Lei , Ping Zou , Yue Wang , Feng Sun , Lei Zhao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03214)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong semantic understanding, yet struggle when user instructions involve ambiguous or conceptually misaligned terms. We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity by extracting meta-relations-inheritance, alias, and composition-from natural language. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these meta-relations. Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these relations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM, improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to process texts of any length without the need for truncation. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the LGM consistently outperforms existing RAG baselines.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03206](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03206)
- **Abstract**:
> Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

## 36. RefAgent: A Multi-agent LLM-based Framework for Automatic Software Refactoring
- **Authors**: Khouloud Oueslati , Maxime Lamothe , Foutse Khomh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03153](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03153)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially influenced various software engineering tasks. Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional LLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code quality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for specific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving contexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and executing workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce RefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software refactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning, executing, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection and tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java projects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a search-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our assessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software quality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the contribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that RefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a median of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a median of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and the search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a median F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent approaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the median compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise of multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring.

## 37. Who Sees the Risk? Stakeholder Conflicts and Explanatory Policies in LLM-based Risk Assessment
- **Authors**: Srishti Yadav , Jasmina Gajcin , Erik Miehling , Elizabeth Daly
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03152](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03152)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance goals.

## 38. From Measurement to Expertise: Empathetic Expert Adapters for Context-Based Empathy in Conversational AI Agents
- **Authors**: Erfan Shayegani , Jina Suh , Andy Wilson , Nagu Rangan , Javier Hernandez
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03143](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03143)
- **Abstract**:
> Empathy is a critical factor in fostering positive user experiences in conversational AI. While models can display empathy, it is often generic rather than tailored to specific tasks and contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for developing and evaluating context-specific empathetic large language models (LLMs). We first analyze a real-world conversational dataset consisting of 672 multi-turn conversations across 8 tasks, revealing significant differences in terms of expected and experienced empathy before and after the conversations, respectively. To help minimize this gap, we develop a synthetic multi-turn conversational generation pipeline and steer responses toward our defined empathy patterns based on the context that more closely matches users' expectations. We then train empathetic expert adapters for context-specific empathy that specialize in varying empathy levels based on the recognized task. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant gap reduction of 72.66% between perceived and desired empathy with scores increasing by an average factor of 2.43 as measured by our metrics and reward models. Additionally, our trained empathetic expert adapters demonstrate superior effectiveness in preserving empathy patterns throughout conversation turns, outperforming system prompts, which tend to dramatically diminish in impact as conversations lengthen.

## 39. Control Barrier Function for Aligning Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Yuya Miyaoka , Masaki Inoue
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03121](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03121)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source language models, aiming to generate positive text.

## 40. CARMA: Comprehensive Automatically-annotated Reddit Mental Health Dataset for Arabic
- **Authors**: Saad Mankarious , Ayah Zirikly
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03102](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03102)
- **Abstract**:
> Mental health disorders affect millions worldwide, yet early detection remains a major challenge, particularly for Arabic-speaking populations where resources are limited and mental health discourse is often discouraged due to cultural stigma. While substantial research has focused on English-language mental health detection, Arabic remains significantly underexplored, partly due to the scarcity of annotated datasets. We present CARMA, the first automatically annotated large-scale dataset of Arabic Reddit posts. The dataset encompasses six mental health conditions, such as Anxiety, Autism, and Depression, and a control group. CARMA surpasses existing resources in both scale and diversity. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of lexical and semantic differences between users, providing insights into the linguistic markers of specific mental health conditions. To demonstrate the dataset's potential for further mental health analysis, we perform classification experiments using a range of models, from shallow classifiers to large language models. Our results highlight the promise of advancing mental health detection in underrepresented languages such as Arabic.

- **Authors**: Victoria Ebert , Rishabh Singh , Tuochao Chen , Noah A. Smith , Shyamnath Gollakota
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03056](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03056)
- **Abstract**:
> Conversational AI is constrained in many real-world settings where only one side of a dialogue can be recorded, such as telemedicine, call centers, and smart glasses. We formalize this as the one-sided conversation problem (1SC): inferring and learning from one side of a conversation. We study two tasks: (1) reconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2) generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning. Further, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing turns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that mark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI.

## 42. Systematizing LLM Persona Design: A Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI Companion Applications
- **Authors**: Esther Sun , Zichu Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02979](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02979)
- **Abstract**:
> The design and application of LLM-based personas in AI companionship is a rapidly expanding but fragmented field, spanning from virtual emotional compan- ions and game NPCs to embodied functional robots. This diversity in objectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applica- tions in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from "feeling" to "thinking and acting" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.

- **Authors**: Neil Byers , Ali Zaidi , Valerie Skye , Chris Beecroft , Kjiersten Fagnan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02936)
- **Abstract**:
> Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure, and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

These AI components are often implemented as AI Agents, offering more autonomy than a plain integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), moving from a Model-as-a-Service paradigm to an Agent-as-a-Service one, bringing new challenges to the development of smart software systems. Indeed, while support for the design, implementation, and deployment of those agents exist, the specification of Quality of Service (QoS) and definition of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) aspects for those agents, important to ensure the quality of the resulting systems, remains an open challenge. Part of this is due to the difficulty to clearly define quality in the context of AI components, resulting in a lack of consensus on how to best approach Quality Assurance (QA) for these types of systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes both a quality model for AI agents based on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, and a domain specific language to support the definition of SLAs for the services provided by these AI agents.

- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.

- **Abstract**:
> Programming languages can benefit from one another by utilizing a language model for software engineering tasks. Full fine-tuning and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Code Language Models (Code-LMs) has been explored for multilingual knowledge transfer. AdapterFusion is a PEFT architecture that aims to enhance task performance by leveraging information from multiple programming languages, but primarily focuses on the target programming language. In our previous work, we proposed AdvFusion, a novel PEFT-based approach that effectively learns from other programming languages before adapting to the target task. Though previous experiments showed that AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion and LoRA, it was applied on pre-trained Code-LMs and was limited to only two tasks, code summarization and method name prediction. In this study, we expanded our work and investigated AdvFusion on Code Large Language Models (Code-LLMs), considering three new tasks: code generation, code translation, and commit message generation. We observed that different Code-LLMs/tasks exhibit different characteristics. In code generation, AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion but not other PEFT methods (LoRA, Compacter, and TaskAdapter). In commit message generation, AdapterFusion performed better than AdvFusion, and contrary to code generation, we found that the other PEFT methods do not have better performance. In code translation, AdvFusion performed worse than AdapterFusion overall, with the performance gap marginally widening as the model size increases. However, consistent with code generation, other PEFT methods showed better performance.

## 47. LM-Fix: Lightweight Bit-Flip Detection and Rapid Recovery Framework for Language Models
- **Authors**: Ahmad Tahmasivand , Noureldin Zahran , Saba Al-Sayouri , Mohammed Fouda , Khaled N. Khasawneh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02866](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02866)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper presents LM-Fix, a lightweight detection and rapid recovery framework for faults in large language models (LLMs). Existing integrity approaches are often heavy or slow for modern LLMs. LM-Fix runs a short test-vector pass and uses hash-guided checks to detect bit-flip faults, then repairs them locally without a full reload. Across multiple models, it detects over 94% of single-bit flips at TVL=200 and nearly 100% of multi-bit flips with approximately 1% to 7.7% runtime overhead; recovery is more than 100x faster than reloading. These results show a practical, low-overhead solution to keep LLMs reliable in production

- **Abstract**:
> AlphaEvolve is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems. To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights. These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.

## 49. SELF-REDRAFT: Eliciting Intrinsic Exploration-Exploitation Balance in Test-Time Scaling for Code Generation
- **Authors**: Yixiang Chen , Tianshi Zheng , Shijue Huang , Zhitao He , Yi R. Fung
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02854](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02854)
- **Abstract**:
> Test-time scaling without interpreter feedback is essential for real-world code generation scenarios where test cases are not readily available. While existing paradigms often rely on either greedy exploitation (i.e., iterative refinement) or stochastic exploration (i.e., relying on sample-based voting or reranking mechanisms), the balance between these two dimensions remains underexplored. To investigate the LLM's intrinsic ability to balance exploitation and exploration, we introduce SELF-REDRAFT, a framework built upon Self-Refine that encourages the model to propose new drafts for solutions that are fundamentally flawed. Our results show that SELF-REDRAFT consistently achieves better performance than Self-Refine when converged under the same maximum number of iterations. Still, we observe that significant room for improvement remains, largely due to two core aspects of current self-redraft capabilities: constrained capacity for generating instructive feedback and fragile discriminative judgment. We also find that balancing strategies vary notably across different LLMs, reflecting distinct, model-specific behaviors. Overall, our study establishes a baseline for intrinsic exploration-exploitation balancing in test-time scaling and identifies feedback and discrimination as key areas with potential for future advances.

## 50. Digital Transformation Chatbot (DTchatbot): Integrating Large Language Model-based Chatbot in Acquiring Digital Transformation Needs
- **Authors**: Jiawei Zheng , Gokcen Yilmaz , Ji Han , Saeema Ahmed-Kristensen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02842](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02842)
- **Abstract**:
> Many organisations pursue digital transformation to enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual efforts, and optimise processes by automation and digital tools. To achieve this, a comprehensive understanding of their unique needs is required. However, traditional methods, such as expert interviews, while effective, face several challenges, including scheduling conflicts, resource constraints, inconsistency, etc. To tackle these issues, we investigate the use of a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered chatbot to acquire organisations' digital transformation needs. Specifically, the chatbot integrates workflow-based instruction with LLM's planning and reasoning capabilities, enabling it to function as a virtual expert and conduct interviews. We detail the chatbot's features and its implementation. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that the chatbot performs as designed, effectively following predefined workflows and supporting user interactions with areas for improvement. We conclude by discussing the implications of employing chatbots to elicit user information, emphasizing their potential and limitations.
