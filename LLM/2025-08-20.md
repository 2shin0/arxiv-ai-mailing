- **Authors**: Jingquan Wang, Andrew Negrut, Harry Zhang, Khailanii Slaton, Shu Wang, Radu Serban, Jinlong Wu, Dan Negrut
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13975](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13975)
- **Abstract**:
> This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool? In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect, they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated with other application domains.

## 2. The Collaboration Paradox: Why Generative AI Requires Both Strategic Intelligence and Operational Stability in Supply Chain Management
- **Authors**: Soumyadeep Dhar

- **Abstract**:
> The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate, evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems for business analytics.

- **Authors**: Yihao Ang, Yifan Bao, Lei Jiang, Jiajie Tao, Anthony K. H. Tung, Lukasz Szpruch, Hao Ni
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13915](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13915)
- **Abstract**:
> Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

## 4. Improved Generalized Planning with LLMs through Strategy Refinement and Reflection
- **Authors**: Katharina Stein, Nils Hodel, Daniel Fišer, Jörg Hoffmann, Michael Katz, Alexander Koller
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13876](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13876)
- **Abstract**:
> LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on 17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains, our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generator.

## 5. Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration for Medical Decision-Making
- **Authors**: Liuxin Bao, Zhihao Peng, Xiaofei Zhou, Runmin Cong, Jiyong Zhang, Yixuan Yuan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13754](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13754)
- **Abstract**:
> Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC) framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage, we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage, we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

## 6. CausalPlan: Empowering Efficient LLM Multi-Agent Collaboration Through Causality-Driven Planning
- **Authors**: Minh Hoang Nguyen, Van Dai Do, Dung Nguyen, Thin Nguyen, Hung Le
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13721](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13721)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop, CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B. Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

- **Authors**: Xiao-Wen Yang, Jie-Jing Shao, Lan-Zhe Guo, Bo-Wen Zhang, Zhi Zhou, Lin-Han Jia, Wang-Zhou Dai, Yu-Feng Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13678](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13678)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge. Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We have also released a GitHub repository including papers and resources related to this survey: this https URL.

## 8. MHSNet:An MoE-based Hierarchical Semantic Representation Network for Accurate Duplicate Resume Detection with Large Language Model
- **Authors**: Yu Li, Zulong Chen, Wenjian Xu, Hong Wen, Yipeng Yu, Man Lung Yiu, Yuyu Yin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13676](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13676)
- **Abstract**:
> To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However, fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

## 9. Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation
- **Authors**: Lei Chen, Xuanle Zhao, Zhixiong Zeng, Jing Huang, Liming Zheng, Yufeng Zhong, Lin Ma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587)
- **Abstract**:
> While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.

## 10. Toward Better EHR Reasoning in LLMs: Reinforcement Learning with Expert Attention Guidance
- **Authors**: Yue Fang, Yuxin Guo, Jiaran Gao, Hongxin Ding, Xinke Jiang, Weibin Liao, Yongxin Xu, Yinghao Zhu, Zhibang Yang, Liantao Ma, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13579](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13579)
- **Abstract**:
> Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR) reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been available at this https URL.

## 11. LM Agents May Fail to Act on Their Own Risk Knowledge
- **Authors**: Yuzhi Tang, Tianxiao Li, Elizabeth Li, Chris J. Maddison, Honghua Dong, Yangjun Ruan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13465](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13465)
- **Abstract**:
> Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?", they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1) their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs: while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$ pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$ over vanilla-prompted agents.

## 12. Discrete Optimization of Min-Max Violation and its Applications Across Computational Sciences
- **Authors**: Cheikh Ahmed, Mahdi Mostajabdaveh, Samin Aref, Zirui Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13437](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13437)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1) post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3) Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at this https URL

## 13. Unintended Misalignment from Agentic Fine-Tuning: Risks and Mitigation
- **Authors**: Dongyoon Hahm, Taywon Min, Woogyeol Jin, Kimin Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14031](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14031)
- **Abstract**:
> Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.

## 14. Ask Good Questions for Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Qi Wu, Zhongqi Lu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14025)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the performance of dialog systems, yet current approaches often fail to provide accurate guidance of topic due to their inability to discern user confusion in related concepts. To address this, we introduce the Ask-Good-Question (AGQ) framework, which features an improved Concept-Enhanced Item Response Theory (CEIRT) model to better identify users' knowledge levels. Our contributions include applying the CEIRT model along with LLMs to directly generate guiding questions based on the inspiring text, greatly improving information retrieval efficiency during the question & answer process. Through comparisons with other baseline methods, our approach outperforms by significantly enhencing the users' information retrieval experiences.

## 15. Embodied-R1: Reinforced Embodied Reasoning for General Robotic Manipulation
- **Authors**: Yifu Yuan, Haiqin Cui, Yaoting Huang, Yibin Chen, Fei Ni, Zibin Dong, Pengyi Li, Yan Zheng, Jianye Hao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13998](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13998)
- **Abstract**:
> Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.

## 16. Chunks as Arms: Multi-Armed Bandit-Guided Sampling for Long-Context LLM Preference Optimization
- **Authors**: Shaohua Duan, Xinze Li, Zhenghao Liu, Xiaoyuan Yi, Yukun Yan, Shuo Wang, Yu Gu, Ge Yu, Maosong Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13993](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13993)
- **Abstract**:
> Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks, including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses. Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks. All code and data will be released on this https URL.

## 17. RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation
- **Authors**: Tianyi Niu, Jaemin Cho, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968)
- **Abstract**:
> We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0°) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180°) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90° and 270°. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90° and 270° rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180° images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.

## 18. Learning to Use AI for Learning: How Can We Effectively Teach and Measure Prompting Literacy for K-12 Students?
- **Authors**: Ruiwei Xiao, Xinying Hou, Ying-Jui Tseng, Hsuan Nieu, Guanze Liao, John Stamper, Kenneth R. Koedinger
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13962](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13962)
- **Abstract**:
> As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly. Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students' prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and 3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1 informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess learning effectiveness and assessment design.

## 19. Prompt Orchestration Markup Language
- **Authors**: Yuge Zhang, Nan Chen, Jiahang Xu, Yuqing Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13948](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13948)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current practices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity, and tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing complex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or managing presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we introduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs component-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples), specialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system to decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It includes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit (IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate POML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user study assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.

- **Authors**: Matey Krastev, Miklos Hamar, Danilo Toapanta, Jesse Brouwers, Yibin Lei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13930](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13930)
- **Abstract**:
> This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a reproducible, end-to-end framework for generating training data using large language models (LLMs). We first assess the reproducibility of the original InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline: (1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve the signal quality in generated queries, and (2) replacing static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts using the DSPy framework. Our results show that both extensions reduce the need for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance. All code, models, and synthetic datasets are publicly released to support further research at: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

- **Authors**: Insaf Nahri, Romain Pinquié, Philippe Véron, Nicolas Bus, Mathieu Thorel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13833](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13833)
- **Abstract**:
> This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS) documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

## 22. The illusion of a perfect metric: Why evaluating AI's words is harder than it looks
- **Authors**: Maria Paz Oliva, Adriana Correia, Ivan Vankov, Viktor Botev
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13816](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13816)
- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment. Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations, validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality, their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent. Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation methodologies.

## 23. Prompt-Based One-Shot Exact Length-Controlled Generation with LLMs
- **Authors**: Juncheng Xie, Hung-yi Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13805](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13805)
- **Abstract**:
> Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs) remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters (Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens), XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt, surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to training- or decoding-based methods.

- **Authors**: Zihan Guo, Yuanjian Zhou, Chenyi Wang, Linlin You, Minjie Bian, Weinan Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13787](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13787)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are increasingly evolving into diverse autonomous entities, advancing the LLM-based multi-agent systems (LaMAS). However, current agentic ecosystems remain fragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for Agentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an open architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still faces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value measurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from inherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale, heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic Web (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not only offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has the potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data ownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and the monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the BetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap, outlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration and autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing products and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives. Ultimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay the foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized digital ecosystem. A summary of the enabling technologies for each stage is available at this https URL.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13774](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13774)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper reports on the implementation and evaluation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for DraCor, enabling Large Language Models (LLM) to autonomously interact with the DraCor API. We conducted experiments focusing on tool selection and application by the LLM, employing a qualitative approach that includes systematic observation of prompts to understand how LLMs behave when using MCP tools, evaluating "Tool Correctness", "Tool-Calling Efficiency", and "Tool-Use Reliability". Our findings highlight the importance of "Docstring Engineering", defined as reflexively crafting tool documentation to optimize LLM-tool interaction. Our experiments demonstrate both the promise of agentic AI for research in Computational Literary Studies and the essential infrastructure development needs for reliable Digital Humanities infrastructures.

## 26. COMPASS: A Multi-Dimensional Benchmark for Evaluating Code Generation in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: James Meaden, Michał Jarosz, Piotr Jodłowski, Grigori Melnik
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13757](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13757)
- **Abstract**:
> Current code generation benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness while overlooking two critical aspects of real-world programming: algorithmic efficiency and code quality. We introduce COMPASS (COdility's Multi-dimensional Programming ASSessment), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses code generation across three dimensions: correctness, efficiency, and quality. COMPASS consists of 50 competitive programming problems from real Codility competitions, providing authentic human baselines from 393,150 submissions. Unlike existing benchmarks that treat algorithmically inefficient solutions identically to optimal ones provided they pass test cases, COMPASS systematically evaluates runtime efficiency and code quality using industry-standard analysis tools. Our evaluation of three leading reasoning-enhanced models, Anthropic Claude Opus 4, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and OpenAI O4-Mini-High, reveals that models achieving high correctness scores do not necessarily produce efficient algorithms or maintainable code. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating more than just correctness to truly understand the real-world capabilities of code generation models. COMPASS serves as a guiding framework, charting a path for future research toward AI systems that are robust, reliable, and ready for production use.

## 27. Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration
- **Authors**: Zhicheng Yang, Zhijiang Guo, Yinya Huang, Yongxin Wang, Dongchun Xie, Yiwei Wang, Xiaodan Liang, Jing Tang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13755](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13755)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.

## 28. Mitigating Cross-Image Information Leakage in LVLMs for Multi-Image Tasks
- **Authors**: Yeji Park, Minyoung Lee, Sanghyuk Chun, Junsuk Choe
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13744](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13744)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural modifications.

## 29. Prediction is not Explanation: Revisiting the Explanatory Capacity of Mapping Embeddings
- **Authors**: Hanna Herasimchyk, Alhassan Abdelhalim, Sören Laue, Michaela Regneri
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13729](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13729)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features, known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based interpretability.
> We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information, concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

## 30. Generics and Default Reasoning in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: James Ravi Kirkpatrick, Rachel Katharine Sterken
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13718](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13718)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations (e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic. Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition. We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles. Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation (mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits of current LLMs for default reasoning.

## 31. Input Time Scaling
- **Authors**: Rapheal Huang (Yuming), Weilong Guo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)
- **Abstract**:
> Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

## 32. Who Gets the Mic? Investigating Gender Bias in the Speaker Assignment of a Speech-LLM
- **Authors**: Dariia Puhach, Amir H. Payberah, Éva Székely
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13603](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13603)
- **Abstract**:
> Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii) Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender inclinations.

## 33. A Comparative Study of Decoding Strategies in Medical Text Generation
- **Authors**: Oriana Presacan, Alireza Nik, Vajira Thambawita, Bogdan Ionescu, Michael Riegler
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13580](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13580)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare, where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks, including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding. Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes exceed that of model choice.

## 34. Evaluating Open-Source Vision Language Models for Facial Emotion Recognition against Traditional Deep Learning Models
- **Authors**: Vamsi Krishna Mulukutla, Sai Supriya Pavarala, Srinivasa Raju Rudraraju, Sridevi Bonthu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13524)
- **Abstract**:
> Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment. This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

## 35. ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs
- **Authors**: Hongxin Ding, Baixiang Huang, Yue Fang, Weibin Liao, Xinke Jiang, Zheng Li, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514)
- **Abstract**:
> Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients. While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.

## 36. LLM-Enhanced Linear Autoencoders for Recommendation
- **Authors**: Jaewan Moon, Seongmin Park, Jongwuk Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13500](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13500)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However, existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

- **Authors**: Tinh-Anh Nguyen-Nhu, Triet Dao Hoang Minh, Dat To-Thanh, Phuc Le-Gia, Tuan Vo-Lan, Tien-Huy Nguyen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13470](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13470)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for enabling automated traffic analysis; however, current approaches often demand substantial computational resources and struggle with fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding. This paper introduces STER-VLM, a computationally efficient framework that enhances VLM performance through (1) caption decomposition to tackle spatial and temporal information separately, (2) temporal frame selection with best-view filtering for sufficient temporal information, and (3) reference-driven understanding for capturing fine-grained motion and dynamic context and (4) curated visual/textual prompt techniques. Experimental results on the WTS \cite{kong2024wts} and BDD \cite{BDD} datasets demonstrate substantial gains in semantic richness and traffic scene interpretation. Our framework is validated through a decent test score of 55.655 in the AI City Challenge 2025 Track 2, showing its effectiveness in advancing resource-efficient and accurate traffic analysis for real-world applications.

## 38. Structured Prompting and Multi-Agent Knowledge Distillation for Traffic Video Interpretation and Risk Inference
- **Authors**: Yunxiang Yang, Ningning Xu, Jidong J. Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13439)
- **Abstract**:
> Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

## 39. Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering
- **Authors**: Hao Zhang, Chen Li, Basura Fernando
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
- **Abstract**:
> In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar, RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question (Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O) settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings, providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new annotations will be released soon.

## 40. ALIGN: Word Association Learning for Cross-Cultural Generalization in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Chunhua Liu, Kabir Manandhar Shrestha, Sukai Huang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13426](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13426)
- **Abstract**:
> As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy: parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by 16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20, and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our 7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI models.

## 41. AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System
- **Authors**: Qixin Wang, Dawei Wang, Kun Chen, Yaowei Hu, Puneet Girdhar, Ruoteng Wang, Aadesh Gupta, Chaitanya Devella, Wenlai Guo, Shangwen Huang, Bachir Aoun, Greg Hayworth, Han Li, Xintao Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423)
- **Abstract**:
> In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.
