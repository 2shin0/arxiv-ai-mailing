- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01992](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01992)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce LLM CHESS, an evaluation framework designed to probe the generalization of reasoning and instruction-following abilities in large language models (LLMs) through extended agentic interaction in the domain of chess. We rank over 50 open and closed source models by playing against a random opponent using a range of behavioral metrics, including win and loss rates, move quality, move legality, hallucinated actions, and game duration. For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. However, unlike existing static benchmarks, the stochastic and dynamic nature of LLM CHESS uniquely reduces overfitting and memorization while preventing benchmark saturation, proving difficult even for top reasoning models. To support future work on evaluating reasoning and instruction-following in LLMs, we release our experimental framework, a public leaderboard, and a dataset of associated games.

- **Abstract**:
> GUI grounding aims to align natural language instructions with precise regions in complex user interfaces. Advanced multimodal large language models show strong ability in visual GUI grounding but still struggle with small or visually similar targets and ambiguity in real world layouts. These limitations arise from limited grounding capacity and from underuse of existing reasoning potential. We present Chain of Ground CoG a training free multi step grounding framework that uses multimodal large language models for iterative visual reasoning and refinement. Instead of direct prediction the model progressively reflects and adjusts its hypotheses leading to more accurate and interpretable localization. Our approach achieves 68.4 accuracy on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark an improvement of 4.8 points. To measure real world generalization we introduce TPanel UI a dataset of 420 labeled industrial control panels with visual distortions such as blur and masking. On TPanel UI Chain of Ground improves over the strong baseline Qwen3 VL 235B by 6.9 points showing the effectiveness of multi step training free grounding across real world and digital interfaces. These results highlight a direction for unlocking grounding potential through structured iterative refinement instead of additional training.

- **Authors**: Jie Meng , Jin Mao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01958](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01958)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are predominantly used as evaluators for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, but their application to broader evaluation scenarios remains limited. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs as general evaluators across diverse tasks. Although LLM-based evaluators have made progress in different areas, existing methods struggle to generalize due to their reliance on costly, human-designed evaluation principles, which are often misaligned with both annotated data and LLMs' this http URL address these challenges, we propose a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm. First, we introduce a rule distillation method that automatically extracts scoring rules from data using an LLM-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), alleviating scalability issues and improving alignment with data. Second, to enable LLMs to effectively apply the learned rules, we propose two strategies: (1) Chain-of-Rule (CoR), which guides LLM to follow distilled rules, and (2) training a rule-augmented LLM evaluator (RuAE) via reinforcement learning, further bridging the gap between rules and LLMs' reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across various evaluation scenarios.

## 4. Predicting Human Chess Moves: An AI Assisted Analysis of Chess Games Using Skill-group Specific n-gram Language Models
- **Authors**: Daren Zhong , Dingcheng Huang , Clayton Greenberg
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01880](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01880)
- **Abstract**:
> Chess, a deterministic game with perfect information, has long served as a benchmark for studying strategic decision-making and artificial intelligence. Traditional chess engines or tools for analysis primarily focus on calculating optimal moves, often neglecting the variability inherent in human chess playing, particularly across different skill levels. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel and computationally efficient move prediction framework that approaches chess move prediction as a behavioral analysis task. The framework employs n-gram language models to capture move patterns characteristic of specific player skill levels. By dividing players into seven distinct skill groups, from novice to expert, we trained separate models using data from the open-source chess platform Lichess. The framework dynamically selects the most suitable model for prediction tasks and generates player moves based on preceding sequences. Evaluation on real-world game data demonstrates that the model selector module within the framework can classify skill levels with an accuracy of up to 31.7\% when utilizing early game information (16 half-moves). The move prediction framework also shows substantial accuracy improvements, with our Selector Assisted Accuracy being up to 39.1\% more accurate than our benchmark accuracy. The computational efficiency of the framework further enhances its suitability for real-time chess analysis.

## 5. Testing Transformer Learnability on the Arithmetic Sequence of Rooted Trees
- **Authors**: Alessandro Breccia , Federica Gerace , Marco Lippi , Gabriele Sicuro , Pierluigi Contucci
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01870](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01870)
- **Abstract**:
> We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.

## 6. H-Neurons: On the Existence, Impact, and Origin of Hallucination-Associated Neurons
- **Authors**: Cheng Gao , Huimin Chen , Chaojun Xiao , Zhiyi Chen , Zhiyuan Liu , Maosong Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01797](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01797)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.

## 7. Who Judges the Judge? LLM Jury-on-Demand: Building Trustworthy LLM Evaluation Systems
- **Authors**: Xiaochuan Li , Ke Wang , Girija Gouda , Shubham Choudhary , Yaqun Wang , Linwei Hu , Joel Vaughan , Freddy Lecue
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01786](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01786)
- **Abstract**:
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integrated into high-stakes domains, there is a growing need for evaluation methods that are both scalable for real-time deployment and reliable for critical decision-making. While human evaluation is reliable, it is slow and costly. Single LLM judges are biased, and static juries lack adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines. These results highlight the promise of adaptive, learning-based juries for building scalable, more reliable and trustworthy evaluation systems for modern LLMs in high-stakes domains.

## 8. LEC: Linear Expectation Constraints for False-Discovery Control in Selective Prediction and Routing Systems
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Wang , Aniri , Tianlong Chen , Yue Zhang , Heng Tao Shen , Xiaoshuang Shi , Kaidi Xu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01556](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01556)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) often generate unreliable answers, while heuristic uncertainty methods fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, causing users to accept erroneous answers without statistical guarantees. We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model.

## 9. SynthStrategy: Extracting and Formalizing Latent Strategic Insights from LLMs in Organic Chemistry
- **Authors**: Daniel Armstrong , Zlatko Jončev , Andres M Bran , Philippe Schwaller
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01507](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01507)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) systems show promises at generating chemically valid reaction steps but struggle to incorporate strategic considerations such as convergent assembly, protecting group minimization, and optimal ring-forming sequences. We introduce a methodology that leverages Large Language Models to distill synthetic knowledge into code. Our system analyzes synthesis routes and translates strategic principles into Python functions representing diverse strategic and tactical rules, such as strategic functional group interconversions and ring construction strategies. By formalizing this knowledge as verifiable code rather than simple heuristics, we create testable, interpretable representations of synthetic strategy. We release the complete codebase and the USPTO-ST dataset -- synthesis routes annotated with strategic tags. This framework unlocks a novel capability for CASP: natural language-based route retrieval, achieving 75\% Top-3 accuracy on our benchmark. We further validate our library through temporal analysis of historical trends and chemically intuitive route clustering that offers more granular partitioning than common previous methods. This work bridges the tactical-strategic divide in CASP, enabling specification, search, and evaluation of routes by strategic criteria rather than structure alone.

## 10. Multi-Path Collaborative Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Jindi Lv , Yuhao Zhou , Zheng Zhu , Xiaofeng Wang , Guan Huang , Jiancheng Lv
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01485](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01485)
- **Abstract**:
> Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet conventional CoT often exhibits internal determinism during decoding, limiting exploration of plausible alternatives. Recent methods attempt to address this by generating soft abstract tokens to enable reasoning in a continuous semantic space. However, we find that such approaches remain constrained by the greedy nature of autoregressive decoding, which fundamentally isolates the model from alternative reasoning possibilities. In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process. M3PO leverages parallel policy rollouts as naturally diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions into policy updates through a lightweight collaborative mechanism. This design allows each trajectory to refine its reasoning with peer feedback, thereby cultivating more reliable multi-step reasoning patterns. Empirical results show that M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Models trained with M3PO maintain interpretability and inference efficiency, underscoring the promise of multi-path collaborative learning for robust reasoning.

## 11. Automated Risk-of-Bias Assessment of Randomized Controlled Trials: A First Look at a GEPA-trained Programmatic Prompting Framework
- **Authors**: Lingbo Li , Anuradha Mathrani , Teo Susnjak
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01452](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01452)
- **Abstract**:
> Assessing risk of bias (RoB) in randomized controlled trials is essential for trustworthy evidence synthesis, but the process is resource-intensive and prone to variability across reviewers. Large language models (LLMs) offer a route to automation, but existing methods rely on manually engineered prompts that are difficult to reproduce, generalize, or evaluate. This study introduces a programmable RoB assessment pipeline that replaces ad-hoc prompt design with structured, code-based optimization using DSPy and its GEPA module. GEPA refines LLM reasoning through Pareto-guided search and produces inspectable execution traces, enabling transparent replication of every step in the optimization process. We evaluated the method on 100 RCTs from published meta-analyses across seven RoB domains. GEPA-generated prompts were applied to both open-weight models (Mistral Small 3.1 with GPT-oss-20b) and commercial models (GPT-5 Nano and GPT-5 Mini). In domains with clearer methodological reporting, such as Random Sequence Generation, GEPA-generated prompts performed best, with similar results for Allocation Concealment and Blinding of Participants, while the commercial model performed slightly better overall. We also compared GEPA with three manually designed prompts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. GEPA achieved the highest overall accuracy and improved performance by 30%-40% in Random Sequence Generation and Selective Reporting, and showed generally comparable, competitively aligned performance in the other domains relative to manual prompts. These findings suggest that GEPA can produce consistent and reproducible prompts for RoB assessment, supporting the structured and principled use of LLMs in evidence synthesis.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01434](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01434)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce CollabToolBuilder, a flexible multiagent LLM framework with expert-in-the-loop (HITL) guidance that iteratively learns to create tools for a target goal, aligning with human intent and process, while minimizing time for task/domain adaptation effort and human feedback capture. The architecture generates and validates tools via four specialized agents (Coach, Coder, Critic, Capitalizer) using a reinforced dynamic prompt and systematic human feedback integration to reinforce each agent's role toward goals and constraints. This work is best viewed as a system-level integration and methodology combining multi-agent in-context learning, HITL controls, and reusable tool capitalization for complex iterative problems such as scientific document generation. We illustrate it with preliminary experiments (e.g., generating state-of-the-art research papers or patents given an abstract) and discuss its applicability to other iterative problem-solving.

## 13. The Necessity of Imperfection:Reversing Model Collapse via Simulating Cognitive Boundedness
- **Authors**: Zhongjie Jiang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01354](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01354)
- **Abstract**:
> Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse. This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators. The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33. Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.

## 14. CuES: A Curiosity-driven and Environment-grounded Synthesis Framework for Agentic RL
- **Authors**: Shinji Mai , Yunpeng Zhai , Ziqian Chen , Cheng Chen , Anni Zou , Shuchang Tao , Zhaoyang Liu , Bolin Ding
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01311](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01311)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language model based agents are increasingly deployed in complex, tool augmented environments. While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements. These results demonstrate that curiosity driven, environment grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn. The code is available at this https URL .

## 15. RoboDriveVLM: A Novel Benchmark and Baseline towards Robust Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving
- **Authors**: Dacheng Liao , Mengshi Qi , Peng Shu , Zhining Zhang , Yuxin Lin , Liang Liu , Huadong Ma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01300)
- **Abstract**:
> Current Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems often leverage large language models to generate driving decisions directly based on their understanding of the current scene. However, such systems introduce multiple risks in real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate whether VLMs are truly viable for autonomous driving, we introduce RoboDriveBench, the first robustness benchmark focused on end-to-end trajectory prediction tasks. This benchmark systematically evaluates two critical categories of real-world challenges for VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems through 11 simulated scenarios encompassing various corruption types, including 6 scenarios of sensor corruption caused by environmental variations, along with 5 cases of prompt corruption resulting from human intervention and data transmission failures. Each corruption type includes 250 unique driving scenarios and 5,689 frames, resulting in 64,559 total trajectory prediction cases per evaluation. To overcome these real-world challenges, we propose a novel VLM-based autonomous driving framework called RoboDriveVLM, which enhances robustness by mapping more multimodal data-e.g., lidar and radar-into a unified latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a new Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method based on cross-modal knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of VLM-based autonomous driving systems. Through extensive experiments, our work highlights the limitations of current VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems and provides a more reliable solution for real-world deployment. Source code and datasets will be released.

## 16. OntoMetric: An Ontology-Guided Framework for Automated ESG Knowledge Graph Construction
- **Authors**: Mingqin Yu (1), Fethi Rabhi (1), Boming Xia (2), Zhengyi Yang (1), Felix Tan (1), Qinghua Lu (3) ((1) University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, (2) University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia, (3) CSIRO Data61, Sydney, Australia)
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01289](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01289)
- **Abstract**:
> Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure frameworks such as SASB, TCFD, and IFRS S2 require organizations to compute and report numerous metrics for compliance, yet these requirements are embedded in long, unstructured PDF documents that are difficult to interpret, standardize, and audit. Manual extraction is unscalable, while unconstrained large language model (LLM) extraction often produces inconsistent entities, hallucinated relationships, missing provenance, and high validation failure rates. We present OntoMetric, an ontology-guided framework that transforms ESG regulatory documents into validated, AI- and web-ready knowledge graphs. OntoMetric operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) structure-aware segmentation using table-of-contents boundaries, (2) ontology-constrained LLM extraction that embeds the ESGMKG schema into prompts while enriching entities with semantic fields for downstream reasoning, and (3) two-phase validation that combines LLM-based semantic verification with rule-based schema checking across entity, property, and relationship levels (VR001-VR006). The framework preserves both segment-level and page-level provenance for audit traceability. Evaluated on five ESG standards (SASB Commercial Banks, SASB Semiconductors, TCFD, IFRS S2, AASB S2) totaling 228 pages and 60 segments, OntoMetric achieves 65-90% semantic accuracy and 80-90% schema compliance, compared to 3-10% for baseline unconstrained extraction, at approximately 0.01 to 0.02 USD per validated entity. Our results demonstrate that combining symbolic ontology constraints with neural extraction enables reliable, auditable knowledge graphs suitable for regulatory compliance and web integration, supporting downstream applications such as sustainable-finance analytics, transparency portals, and automated compliance tools.

## 17. Unsupervised decoding of encoded reasoning using language model interpretability
- **Authors**: Ching Fang , Samuel Marks
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01222](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01222)
- **Abstract**:
> As large language models become increasingly capable, there is growing concern that they may develop reasoning processes that are encoded or hidden from human oversight. To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood. Our work provides an initial framework for evaluating interpretability methods against models that reason in non-human-readable formats, contributing to the broader challenge of maintaining oversight over increasingly capable AI systems.

## 18. Knowledge Graph Augmented Large Language Models for Next-Visit Disease Prediction
- **Authors**: Ruiyu Wang , Tuan Vinh , Ran Xu , Yuyin Zhou , Jiaying Lu , Carl Yang , Francisco Pasquel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01210](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01210)
- **Abstract**:
> Electronic health records (EHRs) support powerful clinical prediction models, but existing methods typically provide coarse, post hoc explanations that offer limited value for patient-level decision making. We introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that generates clinically grounded and temporally consistent reasoning for visit-level disease prediction in MIMIC-III. ICD-9 codes are mapped to PrimeKG, from which disease-relevant nodes and multi-hop reasoning paths are extracted and used as scaffolds for CoT generation; only explanations whose conclusions match observed outcomes are retained. Lightweight LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B and Gemma-7B models are then fine-tuned on this supervision corpus. Across ten PrimeKG-mapped diseases and limited training cohorts (400 and 1000 cases), KG-guided models outperform strong classical baselines, achieving AUROC values of 0.66 to 0.70 and macro-AUPR values of 0.40 to 0.47. The models also transfer zero-shot to the CRADLE cohort, improving accuracy from approximately 0.40 to 0.51 up to 0.72 to 0.77. A blinded clinician evaluation shows consistent preference for KG-guided CoT explanations in clarity, relevance, and clinical correctness.

## 19. Foundation Priors
- **Authors**: Sanjog Misra
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01107](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01107)
- **Abstract**:
> Foundation models, and in particular large language models, can generate highly informative responses, prompting growing interest in using these ''synthetic'' outputs as data in empirical research and decision-making. This paper introduces the idea of a foundation prior, which shows that model-generated outputs are not as real observations, but draws from the foundation prior induced prior predictive distribution. As such synthetic data reflects both the model's learned patterns and the user's subjective priors, expectations, and biases. We model the subjectivity of the generative process by making explicit the dependence of synthetic outputs on the user's anticipated data distribution, the prompt-engineering process, and the trust placed in the foundation model. We derive the foundation prior as an exponential-tilted, generalized Bayesian update of the user's primitive prior, where a trust parameter governs the weight assigned to synthetic data. We then show how synthetic data and the associated foundation prior can be incorporated into standard statistical and econometric workflows, and discuss their use in applications such as refining complex models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting random-coefficient and partially linear specifications. By treating generative outputs as structured, explicitly subjective priors rather than as empirical observations, the framework offers a principled way to harness foundation models in empirical work while avoiding the conflation of synthetic ''facts'' with real data.

## 20. Energy-Aware Data-Driven Model Selection in LLM-Orchestrated AI Systems
- **Authors**: Daria Smirnova , Hamid Nasiri , Marta Adamska , Zhengxin Yu , Peter Garraghan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01099)
- **Abstract**:
> As modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems become more advanced and capable, they can leverage a wide range of tools and models to perform complex tasks. Today, the task of orchestrating these models is often performed by Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on qualitative descriptions of models for decision-making. However, the descriptions provided to these LLM-based orchestrators do not reflect true model capabilities and performance characteristics, leading to suboptimal model selection, reduced accuracy, and increased energy costs. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of LLM-based orchestration limitations and propose GUIDE, a new energy-aware model selection framework that accounts for performance-energy trade-offs by incorporating quantitative model performance characteristics in decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that GUIDE increases accuracy by 0.90%-11.92% across various evaluated tasks, and achieves up to 54% energy efficiency improvement, while reducing orchestrator model selection latency from 4.51 s to 7.2 ms.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01078](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01078)
- **Abstract**:
> While LLM/VLM-powered AI agents have advanced rapidly in math, coding, and computer use, their applications in complex physical and social environments remain challenging. Building agents that can survive and thrive in the real world (for example, by autonomously earning income or running a business) requires massive-scale interaction, reasoning, training, and evaluation across diverse embodied scenarios. However, existing world simulators for such development fall short: they often rely on limited hand-crafted environments, simulate simplified game-like physics and social rules, and lack native support for LLM/VLM agents. We introduce SimWorld, a new simulator built on Unreal Engine 5, designed for developing and evaluating LLM/VLM agents in rich, real-world-like settings. SimWorld offers three core capabilities: (1) realistic, open-ended world simulation, including accurate physical and social dynamics and language-driven procedural environment generation; (2) a rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, with multimodal world inputs and open-vocabulary actions at varying levels of abstraction; and (3) diverse and extensible physical and social reasoning scenarios that are easily customizable by users. We demonstrate SimWorld by deploying frontier LLM agents (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-Prover-V2) on long-horizon multi-agent delivery tasks involving strategic cooperation and competition. The results reveal distinct reasoning patterns and limitations across models. We open-source SimWorld and hope it becomes a foundational platform for advancing real-world agent intelligence across disciplines: this https URL .

- **Authors**: Shenxi Liu , Kan Li , Mingyang Zhao , Yuhang Tian , Shoujun Zhou , Bin Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01045](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01045)
- **Abstract**:
> The scarcity of high-quality, logically annotated video datasets remains a primary bottleneck in advancing Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for the medical domain. Traditional manual annotation is prohibitively expensive and non-scalable, while existing synthetic methods often suffer from stochastic hallucinations and a lack of logical interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{\PipelineName}, a novel neuro-symbolic data engineering framework that formalizes benchmark synthesis as a deterministic graph traversal process. Unlike black-box generative approaches, Med-CRAFT extracts structured visual primitives (e.g., surgical instruments, anatomical boundaries) from raw video streams and instantiates them into a dynamic Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph. By anchoring query generation to valid paths within this graph, we enforce a rigorous Chain-of-Thought (CoT) provenance for every synthesized benchmark item. We instantiate this pipeline to produce M3-Med-Auto, a large-scale medical video reasoning benchmark exhibiting fine-grained temporal selectivity and multi-hop logical complexity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our automated pipeline generates query workloads with complexity comparable to expert-curated datasets. Furthermore, a logic alignment analysis reveals a high correlation between the prescribed graph topology and the reasoning steps of state-of-the-art MLLMs, validating the system's capability to encode verifiable logic into visual-linguistic benchmarks. This work paves the way for scalable, low-cost construction of robust evaluation protocols in critical domains.

- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating the quality of LLM-generated reasoning traces in expert domains (e.g., law) is essential for ensuring credibility and explainability, yet remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of such reasoning tasks. We introduce LEGIT (LEGal Issue Trees), a novel large-scale (24K instances) expert-level legal reasoning dataset with an emphasis on reasoning trace evaluation. We convert court judgments into hierarchical trees of opposing parties' arguments and the court's conclusions, which serve as rubrics for evaluating the issue coverage and correctness of the reasoning traces. We verify the reliability of these rubrics via human expert annotations and comparison with coarse, less informative rubrics. Using the LEGIT dataset, we show that (1) LLMs' legal reasoning ability is seriously affected by both legal issue coverage and correctness, and that (2) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and RL with rubrics bring complementary benefits for legal reasoning abilities, where RAG improves overall reasoning capability, whereas RL improves correctness albeit with reduced coverage.

- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) highlight the need for benchmarks that rigorously evaluate structured chart this http URL grounding refers to the bidirectional alignment between a chart's visual appearance and the structured semantics. This task requires models to produce a symbolic specification that faithfully captures the chart's visual and structural intent, while also recovering the underlying tabular data with precise values and relationships. Chart grounding directly reflects a model's capabilities in numerical reasoning, multimodal alignment, and structural reconstruction, and has several important applications in real-world this http URL benchmarks, constrained by narrow chart diversity, isolated tasks, and incomplete evaluation frameworks, fail to holistically assess grounding. To address this, we propose ChartAnchor, a comprehensive benchmark of 8k+ chart-table-code triples spanning 30 chart types drawn from diverse real-world and augmented sources. ChartAnchor introduces two complementary tasks: chart-to-code generation (synthesizing executable code to replicate charts) and controlled chart-to-table reconstruction (extracting exact data with predefined headers), enabling cross-validation of visual and numerical fidelity. A multi-level evaluation framework integrates semantic validation, stylistic analysis, and perceptual metrics to assess both structural and content-level correctness. Extensive experiments on MLLMs reveal critical limitations in numerical precision and code synthesis, emphasizing the need for structured reasoning beyond surface-level perception. By unifying symbolic and data-driven grounding, ChartAnchor establishes a rigorous foundation for chart grounding, offering meaningful insights for advancing MLLMs in scientific, financial, and industrial domains.

## 25. Minimal neuron ablation triggers catastrophic collapse in the language core of Large Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Cen Lu , Yung-Chen Tang , Andrea Cavallaro
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00918](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00918)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive multimodal understanding capabilities, yet their robustness is poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the structural vulnerabilities of LVLMs to identify any critical neurons whose removal triggers catastrophic collapse. In this context, we propose CAN, a method to detect Consistently Activated Neurons and to locate critical neurons by progressive masking. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5-7b-hf and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7b reveal that masking only a tiny portion of the language model's feed-forward networks (just as few as four neurons in extreme cases) suffices to trigger catastrophic collapse. Notably, critical neurons are predominantly localized in the language model rather than in the vision components, and the down-projection layer is a particularly vulnerable structure. We also observe a consistent two-stage collapse pattern: initial expressive degradation followed by sudden, complete collapse. Our findings provide important insights for safety research in LVLMs.

## 26. Hybrid-DMKG: A Hybrid Reasoning Framework over Dynamic Multimodal Knowledge Graphs for Multimodal Multihop QA with Knowledge Editing
- **Authors**: Li Yuan , Qingfei Huang , Bingshan Zhu , Yi Cai , Qingbao Huang , Changmeng Zheng , Zikun Deng , Tao Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00881](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00881)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Knowledge Editing (MKE) extends traditional knowledge editing to settings involving both textual and visual modalities. However, existing MKE benchmarks primarily assess final answer correctness while neglecting the quality of intermediate reasoning and robustness to visually rephrased inputs. To address this limitation, we introduce MMQAKE, the first benchmark for multimodal multihop question answering with knowledge editing. MMQAKE evaluates (1) a model's ability to reason over 2-5-hop factual chains that span both text and images, including performance at each intermediate step, and (2) robustness to visually rephrased inputs in multihop questions. Our evaluation shows that current MKE methods often struggle to consistently update and reason over multimodal reasoning chains after knowledge edits. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hybrid-DMKG, a hybrid reasoning framework built on a dynamic multimodal knowledge graph (DMKG) to enable accurate multihop reasoning over updated multimodal knowledge. Hybrid-DMKG first uses a large language model to decompose multimodal multihop questions into sequential sub-questions, then applies a multimodal retrieval model to locate updated facts by jointly encoding each sub-question with candidate entities and their associated images. For answer inference, a hybrid reasoning module operates over the DMKG via two parallel paths: (1) relation linking prediction, and (2) RAG reasoning with large vision-language models. A decision module aggregates evidence from both paths to select the most credible answer. Experimental results on MMQAKE show that Hybrid-DMKG significantly outperforms existing MKE approaches, achieving higher accuracy and improved robustness to knowledge updates.

## 27. BioPro: On Difference-Aware Gender Fairness for Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Yujie Lin , Jiayao Ma , Qingguo Hu , Derek F. Wong , Jinsong Su
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00807](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00807)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inherit significant social biases from their training data, notably in gender representation. Current fairness interventions often adopt a difference-unaware perspective that enforces uniform treatment across demographic groups. These approaches, however, fail to distinguish between contexts where neutrality is required and those where group-specific attributes are legitimate and must be preserved. Building upon recent advances in difference-aware fairness for text-only models, we extend this concept to the multimodal domain and formalize the problem of difference-aware gender fairness for image captioning and text-to-image generation. We advocate for selective debiasing, which aims to mitigate unwanted bias in neutral contexts while preserving valid distinctions in explicit ones. To achieve this, we propose BioPro (Bias Orthogonal Projection), an entirely training-free framework. BioPro identifies a low-dimensional gender-variation subspace through counterfactual embeddings and applies projection to selectively neutralize gender-related information. Experiments show that BioPro effectively reduces gender bias in neutral cases while maintaining gender faithfulness in explicit ones, thus providing a promising direction toward achieving selective fairness in VLMs. Beyond gender bias, we further demonstrate that BioPro can effectively generalize to continuous bias variables, such as scene brightness, highlighting its broader applicability.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00756](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00756)
- **Abstract**:
> With the advancement of computational resources, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive Perception and Reasoning (P&R) performance on Graphical User Interface (GUI) tasks. However, although they demonstrate strong P&R capabilities in English GUI scenarios, their performance in multilingual settings has received little attention, which limits their global applications. Moreover, existing studies on GUI tasks lack fine-grained analyses, including widget functions and elements' spatial relationships, which are fundamental for more targeted improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose MPR-GUI-Bench, a Multilingual fine-grained Perception and Reasoning GUI Benchmark to evaluate GUI agents' P&R capabilities. Evaluation results demonstrate that LVLMs exhibit significantly worse P&R performance in non-English languages than in English. To address these gaps, we propose GUI-XLI, a GUI Cross-Lingual Intervention method that applies interventions to the hidden states at P&R capability-related layers to mitigate the gaps between English and other languages, building on previous research showing that the hidden states of different language inputs exhibit significant differences in the latent space. Experimental results indicate that our method improves GUI agents' multilingual P&R capability by 6.5% on average.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00729](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00729)
- **Abstract**:
> Large reasoning models (LRMs) have garnered significant attention from researchers owing to their exceptional capability in addressing complex tasks. Motivated by the observed human-like behaviors in their reasoning processes, this paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy to characterize atomic reasoning steps and probe the ``psyche'' of LRM intelligence. Specifically, it comprises five groups and seventeen categories derived from human mental processes, thereby grounding the understanding of LRMs in an interdisciplinary perspective. The taxonomy is then applied for an in-depth understanding of current LRMs, resulting in a distinct labeled dataset that comprises 277,534 atomic reasoning steps. Using this resource, we analyze contemporary LRMs and distill several actionable takeaways for improving training and post-training of reasoning models. Notably, our analysis reveals that prevailing post-answer ``double-checks'' (self-monitoring evaluations) are largely superficial and rarely yield substantive revisions. Thus, incentivizing comprehensive multi-step reflection, rather than simple self-monitoring, may offer a more effective path forward. To complement the taxonomy, an automatic annotation framework, named CAPO, is proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating the taxonomy-based annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that CAPO achieves higher consistency with human experts compared to baselines, facilitating a scalable and comprehensive analysis of LRMs from a human cognitive perspective. Together, the taxonomy, CAPO, and the derived insights provide a principled, scalable path toward understanding and advancing LRM reasoning.

- **Authors**: Jiaming Xu , Jiayi Pan , Hanzhen Wang , Yongkang Zhou , Jiancai Ye , Yu Wang , Guohao Dai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00722](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00722)
- **Abstract**:
> In this paper, we point out that the objective of the retrieval algorithms is to align with the LLM, which is similar to the objective of knowledge distillation in LLMs. We analyze the similarity in information focus between the distilled language model(DLM) and the original LLM from the perspective of information theory, and thus propose a novel paradigm that leverages a DLM as the retrieval algorithm. Based on the insight, we present SpeContext, an algorithm and system co-design for long-context reasoning. (1) At the algorithm level, SpeContext proposes lightweight retrieval head based on the head-level attention weights of DLM, achieving > 90% parameters reduction by pruning the redundancy. (2) At the system level, SpeContext designs an asynchronous prefetch dataflow via the elastic loading strategy, effectively overlapping KV cache retrieval with the LLM computation. (3) At the compilation level, SpeContext constructs the theoretical memory model and implements an adaptive memory management system to achieve acceleration by maximizing GPU memory utilization. We deploy and evaluate SpeContext in two resourceconstrained environments, cloud and edge. Extensive experiments show that, compared with the Huggingface framework, SpeContext achieves up to 24.89x throughput improvement in cloud and 10.06x speedup in edge with negligible accuracy loss, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy and throughput.

## 31. When Human Preferences Flip: An Instance-Dependent Robust Loss for RLHF
- **Authors**: Yifan Xu , Xichen Ye , Yifan Chen , Qiaosheng Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00709)
- **Abstract**:
> Quality of datasets plays an important role in large language model (LLM) alignment. In collecting human feedback, however, preference flipping is ubiquitous and causes corruption in data annotation; the issue necessitates the alignment algorithms with improved robustness against potential flipped pairs. To this end, this paper introduces a Flipping-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (FA-DPO) algorithm tailored to preference flipping from a reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) perspective. We dissect the inherent human intention model and the preference flipping mechanism introduced by external factors as two distinct stages; in the latter, we introduce an instance-dependent flipping probability on the basis of the Bradley-Terry (BT) model. Further, by leveraging features relevant to preference annotation, we capture uncertainty in judgments and model preference flipping patterns. In practice, we design a simple yet efficient iterative optimization algorithm compatible with the original RLHF and DPO algorithms. In our experiments, we investigate the instance-dependent preference flipping model under multiple circumstances for evaluation of our proposed method, as well as other baseline methods.

## 33. EDIT: Early Diffusion Inference Termination for dLLMs Based on Dynamics of Training Gradients
- **Authors**: He-Yen Hsieh , Hong Wang , H. T. Kung
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00670](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00670)
- **Abstract**:
> Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) refine token generations through iterative denoising, but answers often stabilize before all steps complete. We propose EDIT (Early Diffusion Inference Termination), an inference-time criterion that adaptively stops denoising once sufficient reasoning stability relative to training-time reasoning is detected. EDIT monitors the alignment between token activations and a reasoning map derived from AdamW-aggregated LoRA updates captured during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). During training, optimization dynamics generate rich metadata about parameter importance that in prior methods is typically discarded upon model release. We preserve this information as a compact representation of learned reasoning pathways. During inference, alignment scores are converted to a distribution over the tokens already unmasked at the current denoising step, and convergence is detected when KL divergence between consecutive steps falls below a threshold on the matched unmasked (visible) tokens. Across reasoning benchmarks, EDIT reduces diffusion steps by 11.8% to 68.3% while preserving or improving accuracy in most settings, with approximately 0.02% storage overhead (about 1.5-2 MB for all QKV modules across 32 blocks in an 8 GB model). By utilizing training-gradient dynamics, our work opens a new research direction for reducing dLLM inference time and cost.

- **Authors**: Boyang Gu , Hongjian Zhou , Bradley Max Segal , Jinge Wu , Zeyu Cao , Hantao Zhong , Lei Clifton , Fenglin Liu , David A. Clifton
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00601](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00601)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities through large-scale pretraining and post-training reinforcement learning, demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1. However, current post-training methods, such as Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), mainly reward correctness, which is not aligned with the multi-dimensional objectives required in high-stakes fields such as medicine, where reasoning must also be faithful and comprehensive. We introduce Clinical-Objective Relative Policy Optimization (CRPO), a scalable, multi-objective, verifiable reinforcement learning method designed to align LLM post-training with clinical reasoning principles. CRPO integrates rule-based and verifiable reward signals that jointly optimize accuracy, faithfulness, and comprehensiveness without relying on human annotation. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train Clinical-R1-3B, a 3B-parameter model for clinical reasoning. The experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our CRPO substantially improves reasoning on truthfulness and completeness over standard GRPO while maintaining comfortable accuracy enhancements. This framework provides a scalable pathway to align LLM reasoning with clinical objectives, enabling safer and more collaborative AI systems for healthcare while also highlighting the potential of multi-objective, verifiable RL methods in post-training scaling of LLMs for medical domains.

## 35. Mind the data gap: Missingness Still Shapes Large Language Model Prognoses
- **Authors**: Yuta Kobayashi , Vincent Jeanselme , Shalmali Joshi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00479](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00479)
- **Abstract**:
> Data collection often reflects human decisions. In healthcare, for instance, a referral for a diagnostic test is influenced by the patient's health, their preferences, available resources, and the practitioner's recommendations. Despite the extensive literature on the informativeness of missingness, its implications on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) have not been studied. Through a series of experiments on data from Columbia University Medical Center, a large urban academic medical center, and MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that patterns of missingness significantly impact zero-shot predictive performance. Notably, the explicit inclusion of missingness indicators at prompting benefits some while hurting other LLMs' zero-shot predictive performance and calibration, suggesting an inconsistent impact. The proposed aggregated analysis and theoretical insights suggest that larger models benefit from these interventions, while smaller models can be negatively impacted. The LLM paradigm risks obscuring the impact of missingness, often neglected even in conventional ML, even further. We conclude that there is a need for more transparent accounting and systematic evaluation of the impact of representing (informative) missingness on downstream performance.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00349](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00349)
- **Abstract**:
> Are frontier AI systems becoming more capable? Certainly. Yet such progress is not an unalloyed blessing but rather a Trojan horse: behind their performance leaps lie more insidious and destructive safety risks, namely deception. Unlike hallucination, which arises from insufficient capability and leads to mistakes, deception represents a deeper threat in which models deliberately mislead users through complex reasoning and insincere responses. As system capabilities advance, deceptive behaviours have spread from textual to multimodal settings, amplifying their potential harm. First and foremost, how can we monitor these covert multimodal deceptive behaviors? Nevertheless, current research remains almost entirely confined to text, leaving the deceptive risks of multimodal large language models unexplored. In this work, we systematically reveal and quantify multimodal deception risks, introducing MM-DeceptionBench, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal deception. Covering six categories of deception, MM-DeceptionBench characterizes how models strategically manipulate and mislead through combined visual and textual modalities. On the other hand, multimodal deception evaluation is almost a blind spot in existing methods. Its stealth, compounded by visual-semantic ambiguity and the complexity of cross-modal reasoning, renders action monitoring and chain-of-thought monitoring largely ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we propose debate with images, a novel multi-agent debate monitor framework. By compelling models to ground their claims in visual evidence, this method substantially improves the detectability of deceptive strategies. Experiments show that it consistently increases agreement with human judgements across all tested models, boosting Cohen's kappa by 1.5x and accuracy by 1.25x on GPT-4o.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00344](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00344)
- **Abstract**:
> The LLM field has spent a year perfecting RL for tasks machines already excel at, math, code, and deterministic reasoning, while completely sidestepping the domain that actually defines human intelligence: subjective, emotionally grounded, personality sensitive conversation. This space has often been regarded as inherently subjective and challenging to formalize, making it appear unsuitable for conventional RL pipelines. We show that it is not only possible and it is a solvable and transformative RL problem. We propose the first framework that infers user personality on the fly and optimizes model behavior toward personalized conversational preferences. Contrary to the widespread belief that RL collapses in non-verifiable settings, our method produces consistent, robust, and dramatic improvements in humanlike interaction quality. We also introduce the first dynamic emotional intelligence evaluation suite to quantify these gains. Our model, which is introduced as Echo-N1, behaves far above its base version and outperforming the proprietary Doubao 1.5 Character. This work establishes a new frontier for RL: optimizing models for the deeply subjective, deeply human dimensions of conversation.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00331](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00331)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational tutors in STEM education, yet most systems still rely on a single LLM with a static retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline over course materials. This design struggles in complex domains such as digital signal processing (DSP), where tutors must maintain coherent long-term student models, manage heterogeneous knowledge bases, and adapt teaching strategies over extended interactions. We argue that retrieval, memory, and control should be treated as a coupled cognitive evolution process. We instantiate this view in CogEvo-Edu, a hierarchical educational multi-agent system comprising a Cognitive Perception Layer (CPL), a Knowledge Evolution Layer (KEL), and a Meta-Control Layer (MCL). CPL maintains dual memories and performs confidence-weighted consolidation to build structured, self-correcting student profiles under limited context. KEL assigns each knowledge chunk a spatiotemporal value that drives activation, semantic compression, and forgetting. MCL formulates tutoring as hierarchical sequential decision making, orchestrating specialized agents and jointly adapting CPL/KEL hyperparameters via a dual inner--outer loop. To evaluate CogEvo-Edu, we construct DSP-EduBench, a vertical benchmark for DSP tutoring with heterogeneous resources, simulated student profiles, and long-horizon interaction scripts. Using a three-model LLM-as-a-Judge ensemble, CogEvo-Edu raises the overall score from 5.32 to 9.23 and improves all six indicators over static RAG, simple memory, and a single-agent variant, demonstrating the value of jointly evolving student profiles, knowledge bases, and teaching policies.

## 39. RL-Struct: A Lightweight Reinforcement Learning Framework for Reliable Structured Output in LLMs
- **Authors**: Ruike Hu , Shulei Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00319)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language generation and reasoning. However, their integration into automated software ecosystems is often hindered by the "Structure Gap" - the inherent tension between the probabilistic nature of token generation and the deterministic requirements of structured data formats (e.g., JSON, XML). Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often fails to enforce strict syntactic constraints, leading to "hallucinated" keys or malformed structures, while constrained decoding methods impose significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to bridge this gap. We introduce a novel Multi-dimensional Reward Function that decomposes the structured output task into a hierarchy of constraints: structural integrity, format correctness, content accuracy, and validity. Leveraging Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO), we enable the model to internalize these constraints without the need for a separate critic network, reducing peak VRAM usage by 40% compared to PPO. We validate our approach on multiple tasks, including complex recipe generation and structured math reasoning (GSM8K-JSON). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 89.7% structural accuracy and 92.1% JSON validity, significantly outperforming both zero-shot baselines (e.g., GPT-3.5) and SFT on larger models like LLaMA-3-8B. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of training dynamics, revealing a distinct self-paced curriculum where the model sequentially acquires syntactic proficiency before semantic accuracy. Our model is publicly available at this https URL .

- **Authors**: Zhengzhuo Xu , SiNan Du , Yiyan Qi , SiwenLu , Chengjin Xu , Chun Yuan , Jian Guo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00305](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00305)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for chart comprehension. However, they heavily rely on extracted content via OCR, which leads to numerical hallucinations when chart textual annotations are sparse. While existing methods focus on scaling instructions, they fail to address the fundamental challenge, i.e., reasoning with visual perception. In this paper, we identify a critical observation: MLLMs exhibit weak grounding in chart elements and proportional relationships, as evidenced by their inability to localize key positions to match their reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose PointCoT, which integrates reflective interaction into chain-of-thought reasoning in charts. By prompting MLLMs to generate bounding boxes and re-render charts based on location annotations, we establish connections between textual reasoning steps and visual grounding regions. We further introduce an automated pipeline to construct ChartPoint-SFT-62k, a dataset featuring 19.2K high-quality chart samples with step-by-step CoT, bounding box, and re-rendered visualizations. Leveraging this data, we develop two instruction-tuned models, ChartPointQ2 and ChartPointQ2.5, which outperform state-of-the-art across several chart benchmarks, e.g., +5.04\% on ChartBench.

- **Authors**: Anab Maulana Barik , Shou Ziyi , Yang Kaiwen , Yang Qi , Shen Xin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00267](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00267)
- **Abstract**:
> Technological advancement allows information to be shared in just a single click, which has enabled the rapid spread of false information. This makes automated fact-checking system necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our online media ecosystem. Previous methods have demonstrated the effectiveness of decomposing the claim into simpler sub-tasks and utilizing LLM-based multi agent system to execute them. However, those models faces two limitations: they often fail to verify every component in the claim and lack of structured framework to logically connect the results of sub-tasks for a final prediction. In this work, we propose a novel automated fact-checking framework called Trification. Our framework begins by generating a comprehensive set of verification actions to ensure complete coverage of the claim. It then structured these actions into a dependency graph to model the logical interaction between actions. Furthermore, the graph can be dynamically modified, allowing the system to adapt its verification strategy. Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances fact-checking accuracy, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact-checking system.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01952)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

## 43. Agentic Policy Optimization via Instruction-Policy Co-Evolution
- **Authors**: Han Zhou , Xingchen Wan , Ivan Vulić , Anna Korhonen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01945](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01945)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning. While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.

- **Abstract**:
> The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a surge of interest in agents, leading to the rapid growth of agent frameworks. Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.

- **Abstract**:
> Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) and its variants aim to speed-up training by using gradient corrections, but have seen limited success in deep learning. Here, we show surprising new foundational connections of SVRG to a recently proposed Bayesian method called posterior correction. Specifically, we show that SVRG is recovered as a special case of posterior correction over the isotropic-Gaussian family, while novel extensions are automatically obtained by using more flexible exponential families. We derive two new SVRG variants by using Gaussian families: First, a Newton-like variant that employs novel Hessian corrections, and second, an Adam-like extension that improves pretraining and finetuning of Transformer language models. This is the first work to connect SVRG to Bayes and use it to boost variational training for deep networks.

## 46. Rectifying LLM Thought from Lens of Optimization
- **Authors**: Junnan Liu , Hongwei Liu , Songyang Zhang , Kai Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01925](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01925)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by their emergent reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which enables thorough exploration and deliberation. Despite these advances, long-CoT LLMs often exhibit suboptimal reasoning behaviors, such as overthinking and excessively protracted reasoning chains, which can impair performance. In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gradient descent procedure where each reasoning step constitutes an update toward problem resolution. Building on this perspective, we introduce RePro (Rectifying Process-level Reward), a novel approach to refine LLM reasoning during post-training. RePro defines a surrogate objective function to assess the optimization process underlying CoT, utilizing a dual scoring mechanism to quantify its intensity and stability. These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors.

## 47. Cross-Lingual Interleaving for Speech Language Models
- **Authors**: Adel Moumen , Guangzhi Sun , Philip C. Woodland
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01865](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01865)
- **Abstract**:
> Spoken Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn linguistic competence directly from speech using discrete units, widening access to Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies for languages with limited written resources. However, progress has been largely English-centric due to scarce spoken evaluation benchmarks and training data, making cross-lingual learning difficult. We present a cross-lingual interleaving method that mixes speech tokens across languages without textual supervision. We also release an EN-FR training dataset, TinyStories (~42k hours), together with EN-FR spoken StoryCloze and TopicCloze benchmarks for cross-lingual semantic evaluation, both synthetically generated using GPT-4. On 360M and 1B SLMs under matched training-token budgets, interleaving improves monolingual semantic accuracy, enables robust cross-lingual continuation, and strengthens cross-lingual hidden-state alignment. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-lingual interleaving is a simple, scalable route to building multilingual SLMs that understand and converse across languages. All resources will be made open-source to support reproducibility.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01852](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01852)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual applications but often generate plausible yet incorrect or misleading outputs, known as hallucinations. While hallucination detection has been studied extensively in English, under-resourced Indian languages remain largely unexplored. We present BHRAM-IL, a benchmark for hallucination recognition and assessment in multiple Indian languages, covering Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, along with English. The benchmark comprises 36,047 curated questions across nine categories spanning factual, numerical, reasoning, and linguistic tasks. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs on a benchmark subset of 10,265 questions, analyzing cross-lingual and factual hallucinations across languages, models, scales, categories, and domains using category-specific metrics normalized to (0,1) range. Aggregation over all categories and models yields a primary score of 0.23 and a language-corrected fuzzy score of 0.385, demonstrating the usefulness of BHRAM-IL for hallucination-focused evaluation. The dataset, and the code for generation and evaluation are available on GitHub ( this https URL ) and HuggingFace ( this https URL ) to support future research in multilingual hallucination detection and mitigation.

## 49. ICAD-LLM: One-for-All Anomaly Detection via In-Context Learning with Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Zhongyuan Wu , Jingyuan Wang , Zexuan Cheng , Yilong Zhou , Weizhi Wang , Juhua Pu , Chao Li , Changqing Ma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01672](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01672)
- **Abstract**:
> Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task of critical importance across numerous domains. Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities.

## 50. Learning the Boundary of Solvability: Aligning LLMs to Detect Unsolvable Problems
- **Authors**: Dengyun Peng , Qiguang Chen , Bofei Liu , Jiannan Guan , Libo Qin , Zheng Yan , Jinhao Liu , Jianshu Zhang , Wanxiang Che
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01661](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01661)
- **Abstract**:
> Ensuring LLM reliability requires not only solving complex problems but also recognizing when a problem is unsolvable. Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel "Reverse Construction" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident. Our code and data are available at this https URL .

## 51. LPCD: Unified Framework from Layer-Wise to Submodule Quantization
- **Authors**: Yuma Ichikawa , Yudai Fujimoto , Akira Sakai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01546)
- **Abstract**:
> Post-training quantization (PTQ) aims to preserve model-level behavior; however, most methods focus on individual linear layers. Even recent extensions, such as QEP and LoaQ, which mitigate error propagation or target specific submodules, still rely on layer-wise formulations and fail to capture the behavior of larger submodules. We introduce Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), a unified framework that extends PTQ beyond layers by optimizing relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines. Across diverse LLM architectures and bit-widths, LPCD-based submodule quantization consistently enhances both layer-wise PTQ methods and existing submodule approaches.

## 52. ZIP-RC: Zero-overhead Inference-time Prediction of Reward and Cost for Adaptive and Interpretable Generation
- **Authors**: Rohin Manvi , Joey Hong , Tim Seyde , Maxime Labonne , Mathias Lechner , Sergey Levine
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01457](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01457)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models excel at reasoning but lack key aspects of introspection, including anticipating their own success and the computation required to achieve it. Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning.

## 53. PromptBridge: Cross-Model Prompt Transfer for Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Yaxuan Wang , Quan Liu , Zhenting Wang , Zichao Li , Wei Wei , Yang Liu , Yujia Bao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01420](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01420)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) underpin applications in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and agent-based workflows. In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon.

- **Authors**: Tushar Pranav , Eshan Pandey , Austria Lyka Diane Bala , Aman Chadha , Indriyati Atmosukarto , Donny Soh Cheng Lock
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01419](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01419)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in multimodal tasks but often exhibit Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia (SEA). To address this, we introduce RICE-VL, a novel benchmark evaluating VLM cultural understanding across 11 ASEAN countries. RICE-VL includes over 28,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples -- covering True or False, Fill-in-the-Blank, and open-ended formats -- and 1,000 image-bounding box pairs for Visual Grounding, annotated by culturally informed experts across 14 sub-ground categories. We propose SEA-LAVE, an extension of the LAVE metric, assessing textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification. Evaluations of six open- and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and abstract cultural domains. The Visual Grounding task tests models' ability to localize culturally significant elements in complex scenes, probing spatial and contextual accuracy. RICE-VL exposes limitations in VLMs' cultural comprehension and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations.

## 55. Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning with LLMs: Formulation and Practices
- **Authors**: Chujie Zheng , Kai Dang , Bowen Yu , Mingze Li , Huiqiang Jiang , Junrong Lin , Yuqiong Liu , An Yang , Jingren Zhou , Junyang Lin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01374)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01357](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01357)
- **Abstract**:
> Serverless Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cost-effective solution for deploying AI services by enabling a 'pay-as-you-go' pricing model through GPU resource sharing. However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods.

## 57. Intrinsic Structure as a Proxy for Saliency: SVD-Based Weight Preservation for Mixed-Precision Quantization in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Shashank Landge , Abhishek Patil , Tejas kamble , Bhushan Buddhivant , Priyanka Joshi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01343)
- **Abstract**:
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale in parameter count, deploying them on commodity hardware has become increasingly challenging. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable. In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\%) and SpQR (65.34\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01335](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01335)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly central to robust AI, enhancing large language model (LLM) faithfulness by incorporating external knowledge. However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as "(@_@)" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems.

## 59. Kardia-R1: Unleashing LLMs to Reason toward Understanding and Empathy for Emotional Support via Rubric-as-Judge Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Jiahao Yuan , Zhiqing Cui , Hanqing Wang , Yuansheng Gao , Yucheng Zhou , Usman Naseem
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01282](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01282)
- **Abstract**:
> As web platforms evolve towards greater personalization and emotional complexity, conversational agents must transcend superficial empathy to demonstrate identity-aware emotional reasoning. However, existing systems face two limitations: (1) reliance on situation-centric datasets lacking persistent user identity, which hampers the capture of personalized affective nuances; and (2) dependence on opaque, coarse reward signals that hinder development of verifiable empathetic reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KardiaBench, a large-scale user-grounded benchmark comprising 178,080 QA pairs across 22,080 multi-turn conversations anchored to 671 real-world profiles. The dataset is constructed via a model-in-the-loop pipeline with iterative rubric-guided refinement to ensure psychological plausibility and persona consistency. This progressive empathy pipeline that integrates user comprehension, contextual reasoning, and emotion perception into conversations, followed by iterative critique and rubric-based refinement to ensure psychological plausibility, emotional fidelity, and persona consistency. Building on this, we propose Kardia-R1, a framework that trains models for interpretable, stepwise empathetic cognition. Kardia-R1 leverages Rubric-as-Judge Empathetic Reinforcement Learning (Rubric-ERL), a GRPO-based method that uses explainable, human-aligned rubric rewards to tightly couple user understanding, emotional inference, and supportive response generation. Extensive experiments across four LLM backbones demonstrate that Kardia-R1 consistently outperforms othet methods in emotion accuracy, empathy, relevance, persona consistency, and safety. Our dataset and model will be released at this https URL .

- **Authors**: Yilong Zhao , Jiaming Tang , Kan Zhu , Zihao Ye , Chi-Chih Chang , Chaofan Lin , Jongseok Park , Guangxuan Xiao , Mohamed S. Abdelfattah , Mingyu Gao , Baris Kasikci , Song Han , Ion Stoica
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01278)
- **Abstract**:
> Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on challenging tasks by generating elaborate chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth. To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup.

- **Abstract**:
> Current benchmarks for evaluating the chemical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited by oversimplified tasks, lack of process-level evaluation, and misalignment with expert-level chemistry skills. To address these issues, we introduce SUPERChem, a benchmark of 500 expert-curated reasoning-intensive chemistry problems, covering diverse subfields and provided in both multimodal and text-only formats. Original content and an iterative curation pipeline eliminate flawed items and mitigate data contamination. Each problem is paired with an expert-authored solution path, enabling Reasoning Path Fidelity (RPF) scoring to evaluate reasoning quality beyond final-answer accuracy. Evaluations against a human baseline of 40.3% accuracy show that even the best-performing model, GPT-5 (High), reaches only 38.5%, followed closely by Gemini 2.5 Pro (37.9%) and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think (37.3%). SUPERChem elicits multi-step, multimodal reasoning, reveals model-dependent effects of visual information, and distinguishes high-fidelity reasoners from heuristic ones. By providing a challenging benchmark and a reliable evaluation framework, SUPERChem aims to facilitate the advancement of LLMs toward expert-level chemical intelligence. The dataset of the benchmark is available at this https URL .

## 62. Generative Adversarial Gumbel MCTS for Abstract Visual Composition Generation
- **Authors**: Zirui Zhao , Boye Niu , David Hsu , Wee Sun Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01242](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01242)
- **Abstract**:
> We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are routinely used by physicians and patients for medical advice, yet their clinical safety profiles remain poorly characterized. We present NOHARM (Numerous Options Harm Assessment for Risk in Medicine), a benchmark using 100 real primary-care-to-specialist consultation cases to measure harm frequency and severity from LLM-generated medical recommendations. NOHARM covers 10 specialties, with 12,747 expert annotations for 4,249 clinical management options. Across 31 LLMs, severe harm occurs in up to 22.2% (95% CI 21.6-22.8%) of cases, with harms of omission accounting for 76.6% (95% CI 76.4-76.8%) of errors. Safety performance is only moderately correlated (r = 0.61-0.64) with existing AI and medical knowledge benchmarks. The best models outperform generalist physicians on safety (mean difference 9.7%, 95% CI 7.0-12.5%), and a diverse multi-agent approach reduces harm compared to solo models (mean difference 8.0%, 95% CI 4.0-12.1%). Therefore, despite strong performance on existing evaluations, widely used AI models can produce severely harmful medical advice at nontrivial rates, underscoring clinical safety as a distinct performance dimension necessitating explicit measurement.

- **Authors**: Donghao Huang , Shila Chew , Anna Dutkiewicz , Zhaoxia Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01232](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01232)
- **Abstract**:
> Assessing software test coverage at scale remains a bottleneck in QA pipelines. We present LLM-as-a-Judge (LAJ), a production-ready, rubric-driven framework for evaluating Gherkin acceptance tests with structured JSON outputs. Across 20 model configurations (GPT-4, GPT-5 with varying reasoning effort, and open-weight models) on 100 expert-annotated scripts over 5 runs (500 evaluations), we provide the first comprehensive analysis spanning accuracy, operational reliability, and cost. We introduce the Evaluation Completion Rate (ECR@1) to quantify first-attempt success, revealing reliability from 85.4% to 100.0% with material cost implications via retries. Results show that smaller models can outperform larger ones: GPT-4o Mini attains the best accuracy (6.07 MAAE), high reliability (96.6% ECR@1), and low cost ($1.01 per 1K), yielding a 78x cost reduction vs. GPT-5 (high reasoning) while improving accuracy. Reasoning effort is model-family dependent: GPT-5 benefits from increased reasoning (with predictable accuracy-cost tradeoffs), whereas open-weight models degrade across all dimensions as reasoning increases. Overall, cost spans 175x ($0.45-$78.96 per 1K). We release the dataset, framework, and code to support reproducibility and deployment.

## 65. S$^2$-MLLM: Boosting Spatial Reasoning Capability of MLLMs for 3D Visual Grounding with Structural Guidance
- **Authors**: Beining Xu , Siting Zhu , Zhao Jin , Junxian Li , Hesheng Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01223](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01223)
- **Abstract**:
> 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) focuses on locating objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions, serving as a fundamental task for embodied AI and robotics. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets. Code will be available upon acceptance.

## 66. M4-BLIP: Advancing Multi-Modal Media Manipulation Detection through Face-Enhanced Local Analysis
- **Authors**: Hang Wu , Ke Sun , Jiayi Ji , Xiaoshuai Sun , Rongrong Ji
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01214)
- **Abstract**:
> In the contemporary digital landscape, multi-modal media manipulation has emerged as a significant societal threat, impacting the reliability and integrity of information dissemination. Current detection methodologies in this domain often overlook the crucial aspect of localized information, despite the fact that manipulations frequently occur in specific areas, particularly in facial regions. In response to this critical observation, we propose the M4-BLIP framework. This innovative framework utilizes the BLIP-2 model, renowned for its ability to extract local features, as the cornerstone for feature extraction. Complementing this, we incorporate local facial information as prior knowledge. A specially designed alignment and fusion module within M4-BLIP meticulously integrates these local and global features, creating a harmonious blend that enhances detection accuracy. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly integrates with Large Language Models (LLM), significantly improving the interpretability of the detection outcomes. Extensive quantitative and visualization experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework against the state-of-the-art competitors.

## 67. TempPerturb-Eval: On the Joint Effects of Internal Temperature and External Perturbations in RAG Robustness
- **Authors**: Yongxin Zhou , Philippe Mulhem , Didier Schwab
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01183](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01183)
- **Abstract**:
> The evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically examines retrieval quality and generation parameters like temperature in isolation, overlooking their interaction. This work presents a systematic investigation of how text perturbations (simulating noisy retrieval) interact with temperature settings across multiple LLM runs. We propose a comprehensive RAG Perturbation-Temperature Analysis Framework that subjects retrieved documents to three distinct perturbation types across varying temperature settings. Through extensive experiments on HotpotQA with both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we demonstrate that performance degradation follows distinct patterns: high-temperature settings consistently amplify vulnerability to perturbations, while certain perturbation types exhibit non-linear sensitivity across the temperature range. Our work yields three key contributions: (1) a diagnostic benchmark for assessing RAG robustness, (2) an analytical framework for quantifying perturbation-temperature interactions, and (3) practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning under noisy retrieval conditions.

## 68. Toward a benchmark for CTR prediction in online advertising: datasets, evaluation protocols and perspectives
- **Authors**: Shan Gao , Yanwu Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01179](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01179)
- **Abstract**:
> This research designs a unified architecture of CTR prediction benchmark (Bench-CTR) platform that offers flexible interfaces with datasets and components of a wide range of CTR prediction models. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive system of evaluation protocols encompassing real-world and synthetic datasets, a taxonomy of metrics, standardized procedures and experimental guidelines for calibrating the performance of CTR prediction models. Furthermore, we implement the proposed benchmark platform and conduct a comparative study to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art models from traditional multivariate statistical to modern large language model (LLM)-based approaches on three public datasets and two synthetic datasets. Experimental results reveal that, (1) high-order models largely outperform low-order models, though such advantage varies in terms of metrics and on different datasets; (2) LLM-based models demonstrate a remarkable data efficiency, i.e., achieving the comparable performance to other models while using only 2% of the training data; (3) the performance of CTR prediction models has achieved significant improvements from 2015 to 2016, then reached a stage with slow progress, which is consistent across various datasets. This benchmark is expected to facilitate model development and evaluation and enhance practitioners' understanding of the underlying mechanisms of models in the area of CTR prediction.

## 69. Beyond Greenfield: AI-Driven Productivity in Documentation and Brownfield Engineering
- **Authors**: Krishna Kumaar Sharma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01155)
- **Abstract**:
> Brownfield engineering work involving legacy systems, incomplete documentation, and fragmented architectural knowledge poses unique challenges for the effective use of large language models (LLMs). Prior research has largely focused on greenfield or synthetic tasks, leaving a gap in structured workflows for complex, context-heavy environments. This paper introduces the Discover-Define-Deliver (D3) Framework, a disciplined LLM-assisted workflow that combines role-separated prompting strategies with applied best practices for navigating ambiguity in brownfield systems. The framework incorporates a dual-agent prompting architecture in which a Builder model generates candidate outputs and a Reviewer model provides structured critique to improve reliability. I conducted an exploratory survey study with 52 software practitioners who applied the D3 workflow to real-world engineering tasks such as legacy system exploration, documentation reconstruction, and architectural refactoring. Respondents reported perceived improvements in task clarity, documentation quality, and cognitive load, along with self-estimated productivity gains. In this exploratory study, participants reported a weighted average productivity improvement of 26.9%, reduced cognitive load for approximately 77% of participants, and reduced rework for 83% during the Define phase. As these findings are self-reported and not derived from controlled experiments, they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence of practitioner sentiment rather than causal effects. The results highlight both the potential and limitations of structured LLM workflows for legacy engineering systems and motivate future controlled evaluations.

## 70. SocialFusion: Addressing Social Degradation in Pre-trained Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Hamza Tahboub , Weiyan Shi , Gang Hua , Huaizu Jiang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01148](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01148)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding social interactions from visual cues is a fundamental challenge for a socially competent AI. While powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable general capabilities, they surprisingly struggle to unify and learn multiple social perception tasks simultaneously, often exhibiting negative transfer. We identify that this negative transfer stems from a critical issue we term "social degradation," whereby the general visual-linguistic pre-training process of VLMs impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information. We investigate this behavior further under two lenses: decodability through linear representation probing and compatibility through gradient conflict analysis, revealing that both play a role in the degradation, especially the former, which is significantly compromised in the VLM pre-training process. To address these issues, we propose SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns a minimal connection between a frozen visual encoder and a language model. Compared with existing VLMs, it exhibits positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance and achieves comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks. Our findings suggest that current VLM pre-training strategies may be detrimental to acquiring general social competence and highlight the need for more socially-aware training paradigms.

## 71. Efficiently Learning Branching Networks for Multitask Algorithmic Reasoning
- **Authors**: Dongyue Li , Zhenshuo Zhang , Minxuan Duan , Edgar Dobriban , Hongyang R. Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01113](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01113)
- **Abstract**:
> Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together. We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs. We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\times$ reduction in runtime.

## 72. CycliST: A Video Language Model Benchmark for Reasoning on Cyclical State Transitions
- **Authors**: Simon Kohaut , Daniel Ochs , Shun Zhang , Benedict Flade , Julian Eggert , Kristian Kersting , Devendra Singh Dhami
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01095](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01095)
- **Abstract**:
> We present CycliST, a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Video Language Models (VLM) on their ability for textual reasoning over cyclical state transitions. CycliST captures fundamental aspects of real-world processes by generating synthetic, richly structured video sequences featuring periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes. CycliST employs a tiered evaluation system that progressively increases difficulty through variations in the number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions, challenging state-of-the-art models on their spatio-temporal cognition. We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks. By providing a targeted challenge and a comprehensive evaluation framework, CycliST paves the way for visual reasoning models that surpass the state-of-the-art in understanding periodic patterns.

## 73. When Safety Blocks Sense: Measuring Semantic Confusion in LLM Refusals
- **Authors**: Riad Ahmed Anonto , Md Labid Al Nahiyan , Md Tanvir Hassan , Ch. Md. Rakin Haider
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01037](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01037)
- **Abstract**:
> Safety-aligned language models often refuse prompts that are actually harmless. Current evaluations mostly report global rates such as false rejection or compliance. These scores treat each prompt alone and miss local inconsistency, where a model accepts one phrasing of an intent but rejects a close paraphrase. This gap limits diagnosis and tuning. We introduce "semantic confusion," a failure mode that captures such local inconsistency, and a framework to measure it. We build ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters that hold intent fixed while varying surface form. We then propose three model-agnostic metrics at the token level: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth. These metrics compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors and use token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety.

## 74. Chain of Unit-Physics: A Primitive-Centric Approach to Scientific Code Synthesis
- **Authors**: Vansh Sharma , Venkat Raman
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01010](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01010)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic large language models are proposed as autonomous code generators for scientific computing, yet their reliability in high-stakes problems remains unclear. Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation. As datasets and models evolve, zero-shot code accuracy will improve; however, the Chain of Unit-Physics framework goes further by embedding first-principles analysis that is foundational to scientific codes.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00947](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00947)
- **Abstract**:
> To migrate the remarkable successes of Large Language Models (LLMs), the community has made numerous efforts to generalize them to the table reasoning tasks for the widely deployed tabular data. Despite that, in this work, by showing a probing experiment on our proposed StructQA benchmark, we postulate that even the most advanced LLMs (such as GPTs) may still fall short of coping with tabular data. More specifically, the current scheme often simply relies on serializing the tabular data, together with the meta information, then inputting them through the LLMs. We argue that the loss of structural information is the root of this shortcoming. In this work, we further propose TAMO, which bears an ideology to treat the tables as an independent modality integrated with the text tokens. The resulting model in TAMO is a multimodal framework consisting of a hypergraph neural network as the global table encoder seamlessly integrated with the mainstream LLM. Empirical results on various benchmarking datasets, including HiTab, WikiTQ, WikiSQL, FeTaQA, and StructQA, have demonstrated significant improvements on generalization with an average relative gain of 42.65%.

## 76. Fine-tuning of lightweight large language models for sentiment classification on heterogeneous financial textual data
- **Authors**: Alvaro Paredes Amorin , Andre Python , Christoph Weisser
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00946](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00946)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) play an increasingly important role in finan- cial markets analysis by capturing signals from complex and heterogeneous textual data sources, such as tweets, news articles, reports, and microblogs. However, their performance is dependent on large computational resources and proprietary datasets, which are costly, restricted, and therefore inacces- sible to many researchers and practitioners. To reflect realistic situations we investigate the ability of lightweight open-source LLMs - smaller and publicly available models designed to operate with limited computational resources - to generalize sentiment understanding from financial datasets of varying sizes, sources, formats, and languages. We compare the benchmark finance natural language processing (NLP) model, FinBERT, and three open-source lightweight LLMs, DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B Instruct, and Qwen3 8B on five publicly available datasets: FinancialPhraseBank, Financial Question Answering, Gold News Sentiment, Twitter Sentiment and Chinese Finance Sentiment. We find that LLMs, specially Qwen3 8B and Llama3 8B, perform best in most scenarios, even from using only 5% of the available training data. These results hold in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Our findings indicate that lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) consti- tute a cost-effective option, as they can achieve competitive performance on heterogeneous textual data even when trained on only a limited subset of the extensive annotated corpora that are typically deemed necessary.

## 77. Mitigating Hallucinations in Zero-Shot Scientific Summarisation: A Pilot Study
- **Authors**: Imane Jaaouine , Ross D. King
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00931](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00931)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) produce context inconsistency hallucinations, which are LLM generated outputs that are misaligned with the user prompt. This research project investigates whether prompt engineering (PE) methods can mitigate context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot LLM summarisation of scientific texts, where zero-shot indicates that the LLM relies purely on its pre-training data. Across eight yeast biotechnology research paper abstracts, six instruction-tuned LLMs were prompted with seven methods: a base- line prompt, two levels of increasing instruction complexity (PE-1 and PE-2), two levels of context repetition (CR-K1 and CR-K2), and two levels of random addition (RA-K1 and RA-K2). Context repetition involved the identification and repetition of K key sentences from the abstract, whereas random addition involved the repetition of K randomly selected sentences from the abstract, where K is 1 or 2. A total of 336 LLM-generated summaries were evaluated using six metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity, which were used to compute the lexical and semantic alignment be- tween the summaries and the abstracts. Four hypotheses on the effects of prompt methods on summary alignment with the reference text were tested. Statistical analysis on 3744 collected datapoints was performed using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction. The results demonstrated that CR and RA significantly improve the lexical alignment of LLM-generated summaries with the abstracts. These findings indicate that prompt engineering has the potential to impact hallucinations in zero-shot scientific summarisation tasks.

## 78. Beyond High-Entropy Exploration: Correctness-Aware Low-Entropy Segment-Based Advantage Shaping for Reasoning LLMs
- **Authors**: Xinzhu Chen , Xuesheng Li , Zhongxiang Sun , Weijie Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00908](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00908)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. Recent work studies RLVR through token entropy, arguing that high-entropy tokens drive exploration and should receive stronger updates. However, they overlook the fact that most of a reasoning trajectory consists of low-entropy segments that encode stable and reusable structural patterns. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that the overlap of low-entropy segments across correct responses strongly correlates with model accuracy, while overlaps involving incorrect responses exhibit stable but unproductive patterns. Motivated by these findings, we propose LESS, a correctness-aware reinforcement framework that performs fine-grained advantage modulation over low-entropy segments. LESS amplifies segments unique to correct responses, suppresses those unique to incorrect ones, and neutralizes segments shared by both, while preserving high-entropy exploration in the underlying RL algorithm. Instantiated on top of the popular GRPO, LESS consistently improves accuracy over strong RL baselines across three backbones and six math benchmarks, achieves stronger robustness of the performance floor.

## 79. Look, Recite, Then Answer: Enhancing VLM Performance via Self-Generated Knowledge Hints
- **Authors**: Xisheng Feng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00882](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00882)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit significant performance plateaus in specialized domains like precision agriculture, primarily due to "Reasoning-Driven Hallucination" where linguistic priors override visual perception. A key bottleneck is the "Modality Gap": visual embeddings fail to reliably activate the fine-grained expert knowledge already encoded in model parameters. We propose "Look, Recite, Then Answer," a parameter-efficient framework that enhances VLMs via self-generated knowledge hints while keeping backbone models frozen. The framework decouples inference into three stages: (1) Look generates objective visual descriptions and candidate sets; (2) Recite employs a lightweight 1.7B router to transform visual cues into targeted queries that trigger candidate-specific parametric knowledge; (3) Answer performs parallel evidence alignment between descriptions and recited knowledge to select the most consistent label. On AgroBench, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Weed Identification accuracy by 23.6% over Qwen-VL and surpassing GPT-4o without external search overhead. This modular design mitigates hallucinations by transforming passive perception into active, controllable knowledge retrieval

## 80. Less is More: Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation
- **Authors**: Chunlin Tian , Xuyang Wei , Huanrong Liu , Zhijiang Guo , Li Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00878](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00878)
- **Abstract**:
> Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), but it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in complex datasets. While re- cent works decouple LoRA update matrices to exploit matrix-wise asymmetry, training costs remain high. We revisit LoRA from the perspective of inter-matrix and intra-layer parameter redundancy and propose Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation, EffiLoRA, a lightweight and generalizable approach for language, multimodal, and diffusion models. EffiLoRA employs a unified A matrix across all transformer layers and introduces a runtime selective B matrices up- date to dynamically trade-off the system resource budget and model performance. EffiLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA across diverse modalities, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image generation, demon- strating improved efficiency and robustness.

## 81. HBLLM: Wavelet-Enhanced High-Fidelity 1-Bit Quantization for LLMs
- **Authors**: Ningning Chen , Weicai Ye , Ying Jiang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00862](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00862)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce HBLLM, a wavelet-enhanced high-fidelity $1$-bit post-training quantization method for Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging Haar wavelet transforms to enhance expressive capacity through frequency decomposition, HBLLM significantly improves quantization fidelity while maintaining minimal overhead. This approach features two innovative structure-aware grouping strategies: (1) frequency-aware multi-parameter intra-row grouping and (2) $\ell_2$-norm-based saliency-driven column selection. For non-salient weights, a shared mean is employed across quantization groups within each frequency band to optimize storage efficiency. Experiments conducted on the OPT and LLaMA models demonstrate that HBLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in $1$-bit quantization, attaining a perplexity of $6.71$ on LLaMA$2$-$13$B with an average weight storage of only $1.08$ bits.

## 82. Bias Injection Attacks on RAG Databases and Sanitization Defenses
- **Authors**: Hao Wu , Prateek Saxena
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00804](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00804)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper explores attacks and defenses on vector databases in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Prior work on knowledge poisoning attacks primarily inject false or toxic content, which fact-checking or linguistic analysis easily detects. We reveal a new and subtle threat: bias injection attacks, which insert factually correct yet semantically biased passages into the knowledge base to covertly influence the ideological framing of answers generated by large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that these adversarial passages, though linguistically coherent and truthful, can systematically crowd out opposing views from the retrieved context and steer LLM answers toward the attacker's intended perspective. We precisely characterize this class of attacks and then develop a post-retrieval filtering defense, BiasDef. We construct a comprehensive benchmark based on public question answering datasets to evaluate them. Our results show that: (1) the proposed attack induces significant perspective shifts in LLM answers, effectively evading existing retrieval-based sanitization defenses; and (2) BiasDef outperforms existing methods by reducing adversarial passages retrieved by 15\% which mitigates perspective shift by 6.2\times in answers, while enabling the retrieval of 62\% more benign passages.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00772)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is gaining recognition as one of the key technological axes for next generation information retrieval, owing to its ability to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs)and effectively incorporate up-to-date information. However, specialized expertise is necessary to construct ahigh-quality retrieval system independently; moreover, RAGdemonstratesrelativelyslowerprocessing speeds compared to conventional pure retrieval systems because it involves both retrieval and generation stages. Accordingly, this study proposes SHRAG, a novel framework designed to facilitate the seamless integration of Information Retrieval and RAG while simultaneously securing precise retrieval performance. SHRAG utilizes a Large Language Model as a Query Strategist to automatically transform unstructured natural language queries into logically structured search queries, subsequently performing Boolean retrieval to emulate the search process of an expert human searcher. Furthermore, it incorporates multilingual query expansion and a multilingual embedding model, enabling it to perform efficient cross-lingual question answering within the multilingual dataset environment of the ScienceON Challenge. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, combining logical retrieval capabilities and generative reasoning, can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of RAG systems. Furthermore, SHRAG movesbeyondconventionaldocument-centric retrieval methods, presenting the potential for a new search paradigm capable of providing direct and reliable responses to queries.

## 84. Provable Benefit of Sign Descent: A Minimal Model Under Heavy-Tailed Class Imbalance
- **Authors**: Robin Yadav , Shuo Xie , Tianhao Wang , Zhiyuan Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00763)
- **Abstract**:
> Adaptive optimization methods (such as Adam) play a major role in LLM pretraining, significantly outperforming Gradient Descent (GD). Recent studies have proposed new smoothness assumptions on the loss function to explain the advantages of adaptive algorithms with structured preconditioners, e.g., coordinate-wise or layer-wise, and steepest descent methods w.r.t. non-euclidean norms, e.g., $\ell_\infty$ norm or spectral norm, over GD. However, it remains unclear how these smoothness assumptions manifest in language modelling tasks. In this work, we aim to analyze the benefit of $\ell_\infty$-norm descent (a.k.a. sign descent) directly from properties of the data distribution, namely, heavy-tailed class imbalance. We propose a minimal yet representative setting of next-token prediction, where we can provably show faster convergence of coordinate-wise algorithms such as Sign descent (steepest descent w.r.t. $\ell_\infty$ norm) over normalized GD (steepest descent w.r.t. to $\ell_2$ norm) in the presence of heavy tail class imbalance.

- **Authors**: Jacob Thompson , Emiliano Garcia-Lopez , Yonatan Bisk
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00736](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00736)
- **Abstract**:
> Humans build viewpoint-independent cognitive maps through navigation, enabling intuitive reasoning about object permanence and spatial relations. We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM (Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories), a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans. These findings highlight challenges MLLMs face in developing robust spatial representations from sequential visual input. Consequently, REM provides targeted metrics and diagnostics to foster improved spatial understanding in future models.

## 86. Concept-Guided Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models
- **Authors**: Haoyu Shen , Weimin Lyu , Haotian Xu , Tengfei Ma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00713](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00713)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal text generation, yet their rapid adoption raises increasing concerns about security vulnerabilities. Existing backdoor attacks against VLMs primarily rely on explicit pixel-level triggers or imperceptible perturbations injected into images. While effective, these approaches reduce stealthiness and remain vulnerable to image-based defenses. We introduce concept-guided backdoor attacks, a new paradigm that operates at the semantic concept level rather than on raw pixels. We propose two different attacks. The first, Concept-Thresholding Poisoning (CTP), uses explicit concepts in natural images as triggers: only samples containing the target concept are poisoned, causing the model to behave normally in all other cases but consistently inject malicious outputs whenever the concept appears. The second, CBL-Guided Unseen Backdoor (CGUB), leverages a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) during training to intervene on internal concept activations, while discarding the CBM branch at inference time to keep the VLM unchanged. This design enables systematic replacement of a targeted label in generated text (for example, replacing "cat" with "dog"), even when the replacement behavior never appears in the training data. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures and datasets show that both CTP and CGUB achieve high attack success rates while maintaining moderate impact on clean-task performance. These findings highlight concept-level vulnerabilities as a critical new attack surface for VLMs.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00706](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00706)
- **Abstract**:
> Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have risen to be a promising approach for multimodal tasks. However, principled hallucination mitigation remains a critical this http URL this work, we first analyze the data generation process in LVLM hallucination mitigation and affirm that on-policy data significantly outperforms off-policy data, which thus calls for efficient and reliable preference annotation of on-policy data. We then point out that, existing annotation methods introduce additional hallucination in training samples, which may enhance the model's hallucination patterns, to address this problem, we propose training a hallucination classifier giving binary annotations, which guarantee clean chosen samples for the subsequent alignment. To further harness of the power of on-policy data, we design a robust iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm adopting a dynamic sample reweighting scheme. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks with comparison to 8 state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, our approach reduces the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B on MMHalBench by 50.8% and the average hallucination rate on Object HalBench by 79.5%; more significantly, our method fully taps into the potential of open-source models, enabling LLaVA-1.5-13B to even surpass the performance of GPT-4V.

## 88. Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs)
- **Authors**: Hasi Hays , Yue Yu , William Richardson
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00696](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00696)
- **Abstract**:
> Cellular signaling networks represent complex information processing systems that have been modeled via traditional mathematical or statistical approaches. However, these methods often struggle to capture context-dependent signaling, pathway cross-talk, and temporal dynamics across multiple biological scales. Here, we introduce hierarchical molecular language models (HMLMs), a novel architecture that proposes a molecular network-specific large language model (LLM) to use in intracellular communication as a specialized molecular language, which includes molecules as tokens, protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and regulatory events modeled as semantic relationships within an adapted transformer architecture. HMLMs employ graph-structured attention mechanisms to accommodate signaling network topology while integrating information across the molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention patterns. We demonstrate HMLM superiority using a cardiac fibroblast signaling network comprising over 100 molecular species across functional modules connected by regulatory edges. HMLM achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058 for temporal signaling predictions, representing 30% improvement over graph neural networks (GNNs: 0.083) and 52% improvement over ordinary differential equation models (ODEs: 0.121), with particular advantages under sparse temporal sampling conditions where HMLM maintained MSE = 0.041 with only 4 time-points. The HMLMs offer a foundation for AI-driven biology and medicine with predictable scaling characteristics suitable for interactive applications. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs provide a powerful paradigm for systems biology that advances precision medicine applications and therapeutic discovery in the era of AI.

## 89. ML-Tool-Bench: Tool-Augmented Planning for ML Tasks
- **Authors**: Yaswanth Chittepu , Raghavendra Addanki , Tung Mai , Anup Rao , Branislav Kveton
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00672](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00672)
- **Abstract**:
> The development of autonomous machine learning (ML) agents capable of end-to-end data science workflows represents a significant frontier in artificial intelligence. These agents must orchestrate complex sequences of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, tasks that require sophisticated planning and iteration. While recent work on building ML agents has explored using large language models (LLMs) for direct code generation, tool-augmented approaches offer greater modularity and reliability. However, existing tool-use benchmarks focus primarily on task-specific tool selection or argument extraction for tool invocation, failing to evaluate the sophisticated planning capabilities required for ML Agents. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented ML agents using a curated set of 61 specialized tools and 15 tabular ML challenges from Kaggle. Our benchmark goes beyond traditional tool-use evaluation by incorporating an in-memory named object management, allowing agents to flexibly name, save, and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workflows. We demonstrate that standard ReAct-style approaches struggle to generate valid tool sequences for complex ML pipelines, and that tree search methods with LLM-based evaluation underperform due to inconsistent state scoring. To address these limitations, we propose two simple approaches: 1) using shaped deterministic rewards with structured textual feedback, and 2) decomposing the original problem into a sequence of sub-tasks, which significantly improves trajectory validity and task performance. Using GPT-4o, our approach improves over ReAct by 16.52 percentile positions, taking the median across all Kaggle challenges. We believe our work provides a foundation for developing more capable tool-augmented planning ML agents.

## 90. ART: Adaptive Response Tuning Framework -- A Multi-Agent Tournament-Based Approach to LLM Response Optimization
- **Authors**: Omer Jauhar Khan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00617](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00617)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, single-model responses often exhibit inconsistencies, hallucinations, and varying quality across different query domains. This paper presents ART (Adaptive Response Tuning), a novel framework that employs tournament-style ELO ranking and multi-agent reasoning to systematically optimize LLM outputs. By enabling multiple LLM agents to compete, critique, and collaborate through structured tournament workflows, ART produces consensus responses that outperform individual model outputs. Our framework introduces configurable tournament parameters, dynamic agent selection, and multiple consensus fusion strategies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in response accuracy, coherence, and reliability compared to baseline single-model approaches. The ART framework provides a scalable, production-ready solution for applications requiring high-quality, vetted LLM responses, achieving an 8.4% improvement in overall quality metrics and R22 values exceeding 0.96 in ELO rating convergence.

## 91. Hierarchical Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordination with Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Sharing: Extending AgentNet for Scalable Autonomous Systems
- **Authors**: Goutham Nalagatla
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00614](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00614)
- **Abstract**:
> Decentralized multi-agent systems have shown promise in enabling autonomous collaboration among LLM-based agents. While AgentNet demonstrated the feasibility of fully decentralized coordination through dynamic DAG topologies, several limitations remain: scalability challenges with large agent populations, communication overhead, lack of privacy guarantees, and suboptimal resource allocation. We propose AgentNet++, a hierarchical decentralized framework that extends AgentNet with multilevel agent organization, privacy-preserving knowledge sharing via differential privacy and secure aggregation, adaptive resource management, and theoretical convergence guarantees. Our approach introduces cluster-based hierarchies where agents self-organize into specialized groups, enabling efficient task routing and knowledge distillation while maintaining full decentralization. We provide formal analysis of convergence properties and privacy bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments on complex multi-agent tasks that AgentNet++ achieves 23% higher task completion rates, 40% reduction in communication overhead, and maintains strong privacy guarantees compared to AgentNet and other baselines. Our framework scales effectively to 1000+ agents while preserving the emergent intelligence properties of the original AgentNet.

## 92. AgentODRL: A Large Language Model-based Multi-agent System for ODRL Generation
- **Authors**: Wanle Zhong , Keman Huang , Xiaoyong Du
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00602](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00602)
- **Abstract**:
> The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a pivotal standard for automating data rights management. However, the inherent logical complexity of authorization policies, combined with the scarcity of high-quality "Natural Language-to-ODRL" training datasets, impedes the ability of current methods to efficiently and accurately translate complex rules from natural language into the ODRL format. To address this challenge, this research leverages the potent comprehension and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve both automation and high fidelity in this translation process. We introduce AgentODRL, a multi-agent system based on an Orchestrator-Workers architecture. The architecture consists of specialized Workers, including a Generator for ODRL policy creation, a Decomposer for breaking down complex use cases, and a Rewriter for simplifying nested logical relationships. The Orchestrator agent dynamically coordinates these Workers, assembling an optimal pathway based on the complexity of the input use case. Specifically, we enhance the ODRL Generator by incorporating a validator-based syntax strategy and a semantic reflection mechanism powered by a LoRA-finetuned model, significantly elevating the quality of the generated policies. Extensive experiments were conducted on a newly constructed dataset comprising 770 use cases of varying complexity, all situated within the context of data spaces. The results, evaluated using ODRL syntax and semantic scores, demonstrate that our proposed Orchestrator-Workers system, enhanced with these strategies, achieves superior performance on the ODRL generation task.

## 93. DLRREC: Denoising Latent Representations via Multi-Modal Knowledge Fusion in Deep Recommender Systems
- **Authors**: Jiahao Tian , Zhenkai Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00596](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00596)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern recommender systems struggle to effectively utilize the rich, yet high-dimensional and noisy, multi-modal features generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Treating these features as static inputs decouples them from the core recommendation task. We address this limitation with a novel framework built on a key insight: deeply fusing multi-modal and collaborative knowledge for representation denoising. Our unified architecture introduces two primary technical innovations. First, we integrate dimensionality reduction directly into the recommendation model, enabling end-to-end co-training that makes the reduction process aware of the final ranking objective. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the collaborative filtering signal into the latent space. This synergistic process refines raw LLM embeddings, filtering noise while amplifying task-relevant signals. Extensive experiments confirm our method's superior discriminative power, proving that this integrated fusion and denoising strategy is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our work provides a foundational paradigm for effectively harnessing LLMs in recommender systems.

## 94. Wikontic: Constructing Wikidata-Aligned, Ontology-Aware Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Alla Chepurova , Aydar Bulatov , Yuri Kuratov , Mikhail Burtsev
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00590](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00590)
- **Abstract**:
> Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured, verifiable grounding for large language models (LLMs), but current LLM-based systems commonly use KGs as auxiliary structures for text retrieval, leaving their intrinsic quality underexplored. In this work, we propose Wikontic, a multi-stage pipeline that constructs KGs from open-domain text by extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, enforcing Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $<$1/20 of GraphRAG. The proposed pipeline enhances the quality of the generated KG and offers a scalable solution for leveraging structured knowledge in LLMs.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00504](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00504)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks but encounter significant computational and memory challenges due to long sequence lengths. KV cache compression has emerged as an effective approach to greatly enhance the efficiency of reasoning. However, existing methods often focus on prompt compression or token eviction with local attention score, overlooking the long-term importance of tokens. We propose G-KV, a KV cache eviction method that employs a global scoring mechanism, combining local and historical attention scores to more accurately assess token importance. Additionally, we introduce post-training techniques, including reinforcement learning and distillation, to optimize models for compressed KV cache settings. The code of this paper is available on: this https URL .

## 96. ESPO: Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization
- **Authors**: Yuepeng Sheng , Yuwei Huang , Shuman Liu , Haibo Zhang , Anxiang Zeng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00499](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00499)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning has increasingly relied on group-based policy optimization frameworks, such as GRPO and GSPO, to achieve stable fine-tuning at scale. However, a fundamental trade-off persists between optimization granularity and training stability. While GSPO improves robustness via sequence-level optimization, its monolithic treatment of sequences introduces severe inefficiencies: its conservative clipping mechanism indiscriminately discards valid training samples-a phenomenon we term gradient underutilization-and its uniform credit assignment fails to capture the heterogeneous contributions of critical reasoning steps. In this work, we propose Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel framework that reconciles fine-grained control with training stability. ESPO decomposes sequences into groups based on predictive entropy, enabling (1) Entropy-driven Importance Sampling to capture intra-sequence heterogeneity, and (2) Entropy-adaptive Clipping to dynamically allocate trust regions based on model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ESPO not only accelerates convergence but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably improving accuracy on the challenging HMMT benchmark from 4.4% to 13.13%.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00473](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00473)
- **Abstract**:
> With the continuous advancement of image generation technology, advanced models such as GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image have achieved remarkable text-to-image consistency and world knowledge However, these models still fall short in photorealistic image generation. Even on simple T2I tasks, they tend to produce " fake" images with distinct AI artifacts, often characterized by "overly smooth skin" and "oily facial sheens". To recapture the original goal of "indistinguishable-from-reality" generation, we propose RealGen, a photorealistic text-to-image framework. RealGen integrates an LLM component for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for realistic image generation. Inspired by adversarial generation, RealGen introduces a "Detector Reward" mechanism, which quantifies artifacts and assesses realism using both semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors. We leverage this reward signal with the GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire generation pipeline, significantly enhancing image realism and detail. Furthermore, we propose RealBench, an automated evaluation benchmark employing Detector-Scoring and Arena-Scoring. It enables human-free photorealism assessment, yielding results that are more accurate and aligned with real user experience. Experiments demonstrate that RealGen significantly outperforms general models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image, as well as specialized photorealistic models like FLUX-Krea, in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics.

## 98. SCALE: Selective Resource Allocation for Overcoming Performance Bottlenecks in Mathematical Test-time Scaling
- **Authors**: Yang Xiao , Chunpu Xu , Ruifeng Yuan , Jiashuo Wang , Wenjie Li , Pengfei Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00466)
- **Abstract**:
> Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computational resources during inference. However, current methods employ uniform resource distribution across all reasoning sub-problems, creating fundamental bottlenecks where challenging sub-problems receive insufficient attention while routine operations consume disproportionate resources. This uniform allocation creates performance bottlenecks where additional computational resources yield diminishing returns. Inspired by dual-process theory, we propose \textbf{SCALE} (Selective Resource Allocation), a framework that selectively allocates computational resources based on sub-problem difficulty. SCALE operates through four stages: (1) problem decomposition into sequential reasoning sub-problems, (2) difficulty assessment of each sub-problem to distinguish between routine operations and computationally challenging sub-problems, (3) selective processing mode assignment between System 1 for simple sub-problems and System 2 for complex ones, and (4) sequential execution with context propagation. By concentrating resources on challenging sub-problems while processing routine operations efficiently, SCALE achieves substantial performance improvements with superior resource utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCALE significantly outperforms uniform scaling baselines, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 13.75 percentage points (57.50% to 71.25% on AIME25) while reducing computational costs by 33%-53%, representing a major advance in test-time scaling that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.

## 99. Significant Other AI: Identity, Memory, and Emotional Regulation as Long-Term Relational Intelligence
- **Authors**: Sung Park
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00418](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00418)
- **Abstract**:
> Significant Others (SOs) stabilize identity, regulate emotion, and support narrative meaning-making, yet many people today lack access to such relational anchors. Recent advances in large language models and memory-augmented AI raise the question of whether artificial systems could support some of these functions. Existing empathic AIs, however, remain reactive and short-term, lacking autobiographical memory, identity modeling, predictive emotional regulation, and narrative coherence. This manuscript introduces Significant Other Artificial Intelligence (SO-AI) as a new domain of relational AI. It synthesizes psychological and sociological theory to define SO functions and derives requirements for SO-AI, including identity awareness, long-term memory, proactive support, narrative co-construction, and ethical boundary enforcement. A conceptual architecture is proposed, comprising an anthropomorphic interface, a relational cognition layer, and a governance layer. A research agenda outlines methods for evaluating identity stability, longitudinal interaction patterns, narrative development, and sociocultural impact. SO-AI reframes AI-human relationships as long-term, identity-bearing partnerships and provides a foundational blueprint for investigating whether AI can responsibly augment the relational stability many individuals lack today.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00412](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00412)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful advancement in multi-step reasoning tasks, offering enhanced transparency and logical consistency through explicit chains of thought (CoT). However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations. In addition, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research to support future advancements in this important field. Our code and datasets will be open-sourced.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00403](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00403)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent work on autonomous scientific discovery has leveraged LLM-based agents to integrate problem specification, experiment planning, and execution into end-to-end systems. However, these frameworks are often confined to narrow application domains, offer limited real-time interaction with researchers, and lack principled mechanisms for determining when to halt exploration, resulting in inefficiencies, reproducibility challenges, and under-utilized human expertise. To address these gaps, we propose \textit{SelfAI}, a general multi-agent platform that combines a User Agent for translating high-level research objectives into standardized experimental configurations, a Cognitive Agent powered by LLMs with optimal stopping criteria to iteratively refine hyperparameter searches, and an Experiment Manager responsible for orchestrating parallel, fault-tolerant training workflows across heterogeneous hardware while maintaining a structured knowledge base for continuous feedback. We further introduce two novel evaluation metrics, Score and $\text{AUP}_D$, to quantify discovery efficiency and search diversity. Across regression, NLP, computer vision, scientific computing, medical imaging, and drug discovery benchmarks, SelfAI consistently achieves strong performance and reduces redundant trials compared to classical Bayesian optimization and LLM-based baselines, while enabling seamless interaction with human researchers.

- **Authors**: Ajit Kumar , IndraPrakash Jha
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00376](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00376)
- **Abstract**:
> Protein language models (PLMs) have transformed sequence-based protein analysis, yet most applications rely only on final-layer embeddings, which may overlook biologically meaningful information encoded in earlier layers. We systematically evaluate all 33 layers of ESM-2 for kinase functional prediction using both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification. We show that mid-to-late transformer layers (layers 20-33) outperform the final layer by 32 percent in unsupervised Adjusted Rand Index and improve homology-aware supervised accuracy to 75.7 percent. Domain-level extraction, calibrated probability estimates, and a reproducible benchmarking pipeline further strengthen reliability. Our results demonstrate that transformer depth contains functionally distinct biological signals and that principled layer selection significantly improves kinase function prediction.

- **Authors**: Swadesh Sistla , Max Kleiman-Weiner
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00371](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00371)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models' (LLMs) programming capabilities enable their participation in open-source games: a game-theoretic setting in which players submit computer programs in lieu of actions. These programs offer numerous advantages, including interpretability, inter-agent transparency, and formal verifiability; additionally, they enable program equilibria, solutions that leverage the transparency of code and are inaccessible within normal-form settings. We evaluate the capabilities of leading open- and closed-weight LLMs to predict and classify program strategies and evaluate features of the approximate program equilibria reached by LLM agents in dyadic and evolutionary settings. We identify the emergence of payoff-maximizing, cooperative, and deceptive strategies, characterize the adaptation of mechanisms within these programs over repeated open-source games, and analyze their comparative evolutionary fitness. We find that open-source games serve as a viable environment to study and steer the emergence of cooperative strategy in multi-agent dilemmas.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00325](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00325)
- **Abstract**:
> Bug reports are often unstructured and verbose, making it challenging for developers to efficiently comprehend software issues. Existing summarization approaches typically rely on surface-level textual cues, resulting in incomplete or redundant summaries, and they frequently ignore associated code snippets, which are essential for accurate defect diagnosis. To address these limitations, we propose a progressive code-integration framework for LLM-based abstractive bug report summarization. Our approach incrementally incorporates long code snippets alongside textual content, overcoming standard LLM context window constraints and producing semantically rich summaries. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets using eight LLMs, our pipeline outperforms extractive baselines by 7.5%-58.2% and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art abstractive methods, highlighting the benefits of jointly leveraging textual and code information for enhanced bug comprehension.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00311](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00311)
- **Abstract**:
> Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model student's knowledge state and predict future performance to enable personalized learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, traditional KT methods face fundamental limitations in explainability, as they rely solely on the response correctness, neglecting the rich information embedded in students' problem-solving processes. To address this gap, we propose Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Problem-Solving Process (KT-PSP), which incorporates students' problem-solving processes to capture the multidimensional aspects of mathematical proficiency. We also introduce KT-PSP-25, a new dataset specifically designed for the KT-PSP. Building on this, we present StatusKT, a KT framework that employs a teacher-student-teacher three-stage LLM pipeline to extract students' MP as intermediate signals. In this pipeline, the teacher LLM first extracts problem-specific proficiency indicators, then a student LLM generates responses based on the student's solution process, and a teacher LLM evaluates these responses to determine mastery of each indicator. The experimental results on KT-PSP-25 demonstrate that StatusKT improves the prediction performance of existing KT methods. Moreover, StatusKT provides interpretable explanations for its predictions by explicitly modeling students' mathematical proficiency.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00306](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00306)
- **Abstract**:
> Virtual cell modeling aims to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Existing virtual cell models rely heavily on large-scale single-cell datasets, learning explicit mappings between gene expression and perturbations. Although recent models attempt to incorporate multi-source biological information, their generalization remains constrained by data quality, coverage, and batch effects. More critically, these models often function as black boxes, offering predictions without interpretability or consistency with biological principles, which undermines their credibility in scientific research. To address these challenges, we present VCWorld, a cell-level white-box simulator that integrates structured biological knowledge with the iterative reasoning capabilities of large language models to instantiate a biological world model. VCWorld operates in a data-efficient manner to reproduce perturbation-induced signaling cascades and generates interpretable, stepwise predictions alongside explicit mechanistic hypotheses. In drug perturbation benchmarks, VCWorld achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, and the inferred mechanistic pathways are consistent with publicly available biological evidence.

## 107. Words into World: A Task-Adaptive Agent for Language-Guided Spatial Retrieval in AR
- **Authors**: Lixing Guo , Tobias Höllerer
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00294](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00294)
- **Abstract**:
> Traditional augmented reality (AR) systems predominantly rely on fixed class detectors or fiducial markers, limiting their ability to interpret complex, open-vocabulary natural language queries. We present a modular AR agent system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounded vision models to enable relational reasoning in space and language-conditioned spatial retrieval in physical environments. Our adaptive task agent coordinates MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools to address varying query complexities, ranging from simple object identification to multi-object relational reasoning, while returning meter-accurate 3D anchors. It constructs dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), enabling MLLMs to understand not just what objects exist, but how they relate and interact in 3D space. Through task-adaptive region-of-interest highlighting and contextual spatial retrieval, the system guides human attention to information-dense areas while supporting human-in-the-loop refinement. The agent dynamically invokes coordinate-aware tools for complex queries-selection, measurement, comparison, and actuation-grounding language understanding in physical operations. The modular architecture supports plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining, establishing AR agents as intermediaries that augment MLLMs with real-world spatial intelligence for interactive scene understanding. We also introduce GroundedAR-Bench, an evaluation framework for language-driven real world localization and relation grounding across diverse environments.

> Time series forecasting is central to data analysis and web technologies. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant potential for this field, especially from the cross-modality aspect. Most methods adopt an LLM-as-Predictor paradigm, using LLM as the forecasting backbone and designing modality alignment mechanisms to enable LLM to understand time series data. However, the semantic information in the two modalities of time series and text differs significantly, making it challenging for LLM to fully understand time series data. To mitigate this challenge, our work follows an LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm to fully utilize the advantage of LLM in text understanding, where LLM is only used to encode text modality to complement time series modality. Based on this paradigm, we propose FiCoTS, an LLM-enhanced fine-to-coarse framework for multimodal time series forecasting. Specifically, the framework facilitates progressive cross-modality interaction by three levels in a fine-to-coarse scheme: First, in the token-level modality alignment module, a dynamic heterogeneous graph is constructed to filter noise and align time series patches with text tokens; Second, in the feature-level modality interaction module, a global cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enable each time series variable to connect with relevant textual contexts; Third, in the decision-level modality fusion module, we design a gated network to adaptively fuse the results of the two modalities for robust predictions. These three modules work synergistically to let the two modalities interact comprehensively across three semantic levels, enabling textual information to effectively support temporal prediction. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The codes will be released publicly.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00290](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00290)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for educational applications. However, their unscrutinized deployment poses risks to educational standards, underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation. We introduce EduEval, a comprehensive hierarchical benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Chinese K-12 education. This benchmark makes three key contributions: (1) Cognitive Framework: We propose the EduAbility Taxonomy, which unifies Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge to organize tasks across six cognitive dimensions including Memorization, Understanding, Application, Reasoning, Creativity, and Ethics. (2) Authenticity: Our benchmark integrates real exam questions, classroom conversation, student essays, and expert-designed prompts to reflect genuine educational challenges; (3) Scale: EduEval comprises 24 distinct task types with over 11,000 questions spanning primary to high school levels. We evaluate 14 leading LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings, revealing that while models perform well on factual tasks, they struggle with classroom dialogue classification and exhibit inconsistent results in creative content generation. Interestingly, several open source models outperform proprietary systems on complex educational reasoning. Few-shot prompting shows varying effectiveness across cognitive dimensions, suggesting that different educational objectives require tailored approaches. These findings provide targeted benchmarking metrics for developing LLMs specifically optimized for diverse Chinese educational tasks.

In this work, we introduce the RealAppliance dataset, comprising 100 high-fidelity appliances with complete physical, electronic mechanisms, and program logic aligned with their manuals. Based on these assets, we propose the RealAppliance-Bench benchmark, which evaluates multimodal large language models and embodied manipulation planning models across key tasks in appliance manipulation planning: manual page retrieval, appliance part grounding, open-loop manipulation planning, and closed-loop planning adjustment. Our analysis of model performances on RealAppliance-Bench provides insights for advancing appliance manipulation research

## 111. OmniFusion: Simultaneous Multilingual Multimodal Translations via Modular Fusion
- **Authors**: Sai Koneru , Matthias Huck , Jan Niehues
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00234](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00234)
- **Abstract**:
> There has been significant progress in open-source text-only translation large language models (LLMs) with better language coverage and quality. However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that OmniFusion effectively leverages both audio and visual inputs, achieves a 1-second latency reduction in SimulST compared to cascaded pipelines and also improves the overall translation quality\footnote{Code is available at this https URL }.

## 112. CodeFlowLM: Incremental Just-In-Time Defect Prediction with Pretrained Language Models and Exploratory Insights into Defect Localization
- **Authors**: Monique Louise Monteiro , George G. Cabral , Adriano L. I. OLiveira
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00231](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00231)
- **Abstract**:
> This work introduces CodeFlowLM, an incremental learning framework for Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (JIT-SDP) that leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs). Unlike traditional online learners, CodeFlowLM employs continual fine-tuning to address concept drift, class imbalance, and verification latency without retraining from scratch. We evaluated encoder-only and encoder-decoder PLMs (notably CodeT5+ and UniXCoder) in JIT-SDP scenarios within and between projects, comparing them with the incremental baseline BORB. The results show that CodeFlowLM achieves up to 68% G-Mean gains, confirming its superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. We further extend the analysis to Just-in-Time Defect Localization (JIT-DL), benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro against attention-based models. GPT-5 delivers comparable performance for Recall@20% and Effort@20% with higher stability, although attention-based methods retain an advantage in fine-grained ranking metrics (Top-k, IFA). A qualitative error analysis reveals that most false positives arise from (1) human-like conservative bias, (2) insufficient contextual information in diff-based prompts, and (3) potential dataset mislabeling in JIT-Defects4J. These findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of LLM reasoning in defect localization. False negatives occur in smaller proportions. Overall, CodeFlowLM significantly advances the state of the art in incremental JIT-SDP, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. Furthermore, our exploratory analysis of LLMs in JIT-DL not only benchmarks their performance against established attention-based models but also provides critical insights into the current limitations of prompt-based defect reasoning.

- **Authors**: Zirui Wang , Tao Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00226)
- **Abstract**:
> 3D understanding is a key capability for real-world AI assistance. High-quality data plays an important role in driving the development of the 3D understanding community. Current 3D scene understanding datasets often provide geometric and instance-level information, yet they lack the rich semantic annotations necessary for nuanced visual-language this http URL this work, we introduce DenseScan, a novel dataset with detailed multi-level descriptions generated by an automated pipeline leveraging multi-view 2D images and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach enables dense captioning of scene elements, ensuring comprehensive object-level descriptions that capture context-sensitive details. Furthermore, we extend these annotations through scenario-based question generation, producing high-level queries that integrate object properties, spatial relationships, and scene context. By coupling geometric detail with semantic richness, DenseScan broadens the range of downstream tasks, from detailed visual-language navigation to interactive question answering. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances object-level understanding and question-answering performance in 3D environments compared to traditional annotation pipelines. We release both the annotated dataset and our annotation pipeline to facilitate future research and applications in robotics, augmented reality, and beyond. Through DenseScan, we aim to catalyze new avenues in 3D scene understanding, allowing researchers and practitioners to tackle the complexities of real-world environments with richer, more contextually aware annotations.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00207](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00207)
- **Abstract**:
> The success of large language models (LLMs) can be attributed in part to their ability to efficiently store factual knowledge as key-value mappings within their MLP parameters. Recent work has proposed explicit weight constructions to build such fact-storing MLPs, providing an improved understanding of LLM fact storage mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce an MLP construction framework that improves over previous constructions in three areas: it 1) works for all but a measure-zero set of feasible input-output pairs, 2) achieves asymptotically optimal parameter efficiency matching information-theoretic bounds for some embeddings, and 3) maintains usability within Transformers for factual recall. Through our improvements, we 1) discover a metric on value embeddings that characterizes facts-per-parameter scaling for both constructed and gradient-descent-trained MLPs, 2) identify a simple encoder-decoder mechanism that empirically matches gradient-descent MLP facts-per-parameter asymptotics across all the inputs and outputs we test, and 3) uncover a fundamental tradeoff between an MLP's fact-storage capacity and its usability within Transformers. Finally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of fact-storing MLPs: modular fact editing on one-layer Transformers by \textit{replacing entire MLPs at once}.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00134](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00134)
- **Abstract**:
> Assembly-to-source code translation is a critical task in reverse engineering, cybersecurity, and software maintenance, yet systematic benchmarks for evaluating large language models on this problem remain scarce. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art large language models on assembly-to-source translation. We assess model performance using a diverse set of metrics capturing lexical similarity (BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR), semantic alignment (BERTScore), fluency (Perplexity), and efficiency (time prediction). Our results reveal clear trade-offs: while certain models excel in text similarity metrics, others demonstrate lower perplexity or faster inference times. We further provide qualitative analyses of typical model successes and failure cases, highlighting challenges such as control flow recovery and identifier reconstruction. Taken together, our benchmark offers actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current large language models for program translation, establishing a foundation for future research in combining accuracy with efficiency for real-world applications.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00127](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00127)
- **Abstract**:
> Teaching language models to reason about code execution remains a fundamental challenge. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise, current synthetic training data suffers from a critical weakness: the reasoning steps are often plausible-sounding explanations generated by teacher models, not verifiable accounts of what the code actually does. This creates a troubling failure mode where models learn to mimic superficially convincing but logically flawed reasoning patterns. We address this by grounding CoT generation directly in program execution traces. Our pipeline instruments code to capture its dynamic behavior, then narrates these verified execution traces into natural language rationales that are correct by construction. This execution-grounded approach ensures every reasoning step reflects what the program genuinely computes, eliminating logical hallucinations at the source. We evaluate our method on code reasoning tasks (forward reasoning on CruxEval and LiveCodeBench-Exec, backward reasoning on CruxEval-Input), as well as code generation and explanation tasks from HumanEval. Models trained on our bi-directional trace-grounded data achieve substantial improvements, with gains of up to 30 points on output prediction and 28 points on input prediction over base models, alongside improved explanation and code generation, demonstrating that verifiable reasoning fundamentally enhances model capabilities. this https URL

## 117. RadDiff: Retrieval-Augmented Denoising Diffusion for Protein Inverse Folding
- **Authors**: Jin Han , Tianfan Fu , Wu-Jun Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00126](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00126)
- **Abstract**:
> Protein inverse folding, the design of an amino acid sequence based on a target 3D structure, is a fundamental problem of computational protein engineering. Existing methods either generate sequences without leveraging external knowledge or relying on protein language models (PLMs). The former omits the evolutionary information stored in protein databases, while the latter is parameter-inefficient and inflexible to adapt to ever-growing protein data. To overcome the above drawbacks, in this paper we propose a novel method, called retrieval-augmented denoising diffusion (RadDiff), for protein inverse folding. Given the target protein backbone, RadDiff uses a hierarchical search strategy to efficiently retrieve structurally similar proteins from large protein databases. The retrieved structures are then aligned residue-by-residue to the target to construct a position-specific amino acid profile, which serves as an evolutionary-informed prior that conditions the denoising process. A lightweight integration module is further designed to incorporate this prior effectively. Experimental results on the CATH, PDB, and TS50 datasets show that RadDiff consistently outperforms existing methods, improving sequence recovery rate by up to 19%. Experimental results also demonstrate that RadDiff generates highly foldable sequences and scales effectively with database size.

- **Authors**: Jiaying Hong , Ting Zhu , Thanet Markchom , Huizhi Liang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00120](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00120)
- **Abstract**:
> With the rise of AI-generated content (AIGC), generating perceptually natural and feeling-aligned music from multimodal inputs has become a central challenge. Existing approaches often rely on explicit emotion labels that require costly annotation, underscoring the need for more flexible feeling-aligned methods. To support multimodal music generation, we construct ArtiCaps, a pseudo feeling-aligned image-music-text dataset created by semantically matching descriptions from ArtEmis and MusicCaps. We further propose Art2Music, a lightweight cross-modal framework that synthesizes music from artistic images and user comments. In the first stage, images and text are encoded with OpenCLIP and fused using a gated residual module; the fused representation is decoded by a bidirectional LSTM into Mel-spectrograms with a frequency-weighted L1 loss to enhance high-frequency fidelity. In the second stage, a fine-tuned HiFi-GAN vocoder reconstructs high-quality audio waveforms. Experiments on ArtiCaps show clear improvements in Mel-Cepstral Distortion, Frechet Audio Distance, Log-Spectral Distance, and cosine similarity. A small LLM-based rating study further verifies consistent cross-modal feeling alignment and offers interpretable explanations of matches and mismatches across modalities. These results demonstrate improved perceptual naturalness, spectral fidelity, and semantic consistency. Art2Music also maintains robust performance with only 50k training samples, providing a scalable solution for feeling-aligned creative audio generation in interactive art, personalized soundscapes, and digital art exhibitions.

- **Authors**: Zeng Wang , Minghao Shao , Akashdeep Saha , Ramesh Karri , Johann Knechtel , Muhammad Shafique , Ozgur Sinanoglu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00119](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00119)
- **Abstract**:
> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in hardware security by learning structural motifs from netlist graphs. However, this reliance on motifs makes GNNs vulnerable to adversarial netlist rewrites; even small-scale edits can mislead GNN predictions. Existing adversarial approaches, ranging from synthesis-recipe perturbations to gate transformations, come with high design overheads. We present NetDeTox, an automated end-to-end framework that orchestrates large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) in a systematic manner, enabling focused local rewriting. The RL agent identifies netlist components critical for GNN-based reasoning, while the LLM devises rewriting plans to diversify motifs that preserve functionality. Iterative feedback between the RL and LLM stages refines adversarial rewritings to limit overheads. Compared to the SOTA work AttackGNN, NetDeTox successfully degrades the effectiveness of all security schemes with fewer rewrites and substantially lower area overheads (reductions of 54.50% for GNN-RE, 25.44% for GNN4IP, and 41.04% for OMLA, respectively). For GNN4IP, ours can even optimize/reduce the original benchmarks' area, in particular for larger circuits, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of NetDeTox.

## 120. Enhancing Cognitive Robotics with Commonsense through LLM-Generated Preconditions and Subgoals
- **Authors**: Ohad Bachner , Bar Gamliel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00069](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00069)
- **Abstract**:
> Robots often fail at everyday tasks because instructions skip commonsense details like hidden preconditions and small subgoals. Traditional symbolic planners need these details to be written explicitly, which is time consuming and often incomplete. In this project we combine a Large Language Model with symbolic planning. Given a natural language task, the LLM suggests plausible preconditions and subgoals. We translate these suggestions into a formal planning model and execute the resulting plan in simulation. Compared to a baseline planner without the LLM step, our system produces more valid plans, achieves a higher task success rate, and adapts better when the environment changes. These results suggest that adding LLM commonsense to classical planning can make robot behavior in realistic scenarios more reliable.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00048](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00048)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces significant challenges in adaptive healthcare interventions, such as dementia care, where data is scarce, decisions require interpretability, and underlying patient-state dynamic are complex and causal in nature. In this work, we present a novel framework called Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that explicitly integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization. This method enables an agent to learn and exploit a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that describes the causal dependencies between human behavioral states and robot actions, facilitating more efficient, interpretable, and robust decision-making. We validate our approach in a simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenario, where the agent interacts with a virtual patient exhibiting dynamic emotional, cognitive, and engagement states. The experimental results show that CRL agents outperform conventional model-free RL baselines by achieving higher cumulative rewards, maintaining desirable patient states more consistently, and exhibiting interpretable, clinically-aligned behavior. We further demonstrate that CRL's performance advantage remains robust across different weighting strategies and hyperparameter settings. In addition, we demonstrate a lightweight LLM-based deployment: a fixed policy is embedded into a system prompt that maps inferred states to actions, producing consistent, supportive dialogue without LLM finetuning. Our work illustrates the promise of causal reinforcement learning for human-robot interaction applications, where interpretability, adaptiveness, and data efficiency are paramount.

## 122. Emergent Convergence in Multi-Agent LLM Annotation
- **Authors**: Angelina Parfenova , Alexander Denzler , Juergen Pfeffer
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00047](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00047)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in collaborative settings, yet little is known about how they coordinate when treated as black-box agents. We simulate 7500 multi-agent, multi-round discussions in an inductive coding task, generating over 125000 utterances that capture both final annotations and their interactional histories. We introduce process-level metrics: code stability, semantic self-consistency, and lexical confidence alongside sentiment and convergence measures, to track coordination dynamics. To probe deeper alignment signals, we analyze the evolving geometry of output embeddings, showing that intrinsic dimensionality declines over rounds, suggesting semantic compression. The results reveal that LLM groups converge lexically and semantically, develop asymmetric influence patterns, and exhibit negotiation-like behaviors despite the absence of explicit role prompting. This work demonstrates how black-box interaction analysis can surface emergent coordination strategies, offering a scalable complement to internal probe-based interpretability methods.

## 123. Text Annotation via Inductive Coding: Comparing Human Experts to LLMs in Qualitative Data Analysis
- **Authors**: Angelina Parfenova , Andreas Marfurt , Alexander Denzler , Juergen Pfeffer
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00046](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00046)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper investigates the automation of qualitative data analysis, focusing on inductive coding using large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that rely on deductive methods with predefined labels, this research investigates the inductive process where labels emerge from the data. The study evaluates the performance of six open-source LLMs compared to human experts. As part of the evaluation, experts rated the perceived difficulty of the quotes they coded. The results reveal a peculiar dichotomy: human coders consistently perform well when labeling complex sentences but struggle with simpler ones, while LLMs exhibit the opposite trend. Additionally, the study explores systematic deviations in both human and LLM generated labels by comparing them to the golden standard from the test set. While human annotations may sometimes differ from the golden standard, they are often rated more favorably by other humans. In contrast, some LLMs demonstrate closer alignment with the true labels but receive lower evaluations from experts.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00045](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00045)
- **Abstract**:
> As IC design grows more complex, automating comprehension and documentation of RTL code has become increasingly important. Engineers currently should manually interpret existing RTL code and write specifications, a slow and error-prone process. Although LLMs have been studied for generating RTL from specifications, automated specification generation remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of reliable evaluation methods. To address this gap, we investigate how prompting strategies affect RTL-to-specification quality and introduce metrics for faithfully evaluating generated specs. We also benchmark open-source and commercial LLMs, providing a foundation for more automated and efficient specification workflows in IC design.

## 125. Closing the Gap: Data-Centric Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models for the Standardized Exam Questions
- **Authors**: Egemen Sert , Şeyda Ertekin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00042](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00042)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal reasoning has become a cornerstone of modern AI research. Standardized exam questions offer a uniquely rigorous testbed for such reasoning, providing structured visual contexts and verifiable answers. While recent progress has largely focused on algorithmic advances such as reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO, DPO), the data centric foundations of vision language reasoning remain less explored. We show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data can rival proprietary approaches. To this end, we compile a 161.4 million token multimodal dataset combining textbook question-solution pairs, curriculum aligned diagrams, and contextual materials, and fine-tune Qwen-2.5VL-32B using an optimized reasoning syntax (QMSA). The resulting model achieves 78.6% accuracy, only 1.0% below Gemini 2.0 Flash, on our newly released benchmark YKSUniform, which standardizes 1,854 multimodal exam questions across 309 curriculum topics. Our results reveal that data composition and representational syntax play a decisive role in multimodal reasoning. This work establishes a data centric framework for advancing open weight vision language models, demonstrating that carefully curated and curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance.

## 126. Constrained Network Slice Assignment via Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Sagar Sudhakara , Pankaj Rajak
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00040](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00040)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern networks support network slicing, which partitions physical infrastructure into virtual slices tailored to different service requirements (for example, high bandwidth or low latency). Optimally allocating users to slices is a constrained optimization problem that traditionally requires complex algorithms. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle radio resource allocation for network slicing. We focus on two approaches: (1) using an LLM in a zero-shot setting to directly assign user service requests to slices, and (2) formulating an integer programming model where the LLM provides semantic insight by estimating similarity between requests. Our experiments show that an LLM, even with zero-shot prompting, can produce a reasonable first draft of slice assignments, although it may violate some capacity or latency constraints. We then incorporate the LLM's understanding of service requirements into an optimization solver to generate an improved allocation. The results demonstrate that LLM-guided grouping of requests, based on minimal textual input, achieves performance comparable to traditional methods that use detailed numerical data, in terms of resource utilization and slice isolation. While the LLM alone does not perfectly satisfy all constraints, it significantly reduces the search space and, when combined with exact solvers, provides a promising approach for efficient 5G network slicing resource allocation.

## 127. LM4Opt-RA: A Multi-Candidate LLM Framework with Structured Ranking for Automating Network Resource Allocation
- **Authors**: Tasnim Ahmed , Siana Rizwan , Naveed Ejaz , Salimur Choudhury
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00039](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00039)
- **Abstract**:
> Building on advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we can tackle complex analytical and mathematical reasoning tasks requiring nuanced contextual understanding. A prime example of such complex tasks is modelling resource allocation optimization in networks, which extends beyond translating natural language inputs into mathematical equations or Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. However, existing benchmarks and datasets cannot address the complexities of such problems with dynamic environments, interdependent variables, and heterogeneous constraints. To address this gap, we introduce NL4RA, a curated dataset comprising 50 resource allocation optimization problems formulated as LP, ILP, and MILP. We then evaluate the performance of well-known open-source LLMs with varying parameter counts. To enhance existing LLM based methods, we introduce LM4Opt RA, a multi candidate framework that applies diverse prompting strategies such as direct, few shot, and chain of thought, combined with a structured ranking mechanism to improve accuracy. We identified discrepancies between human judgments and automated scoring such as ROUGE, BLEU, or BERT scores. However, human evaluation is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, making it impractical for a fully automated end-to-end framework. To quantify the difference between LLM-generated responses and ground truth, we introduce LLM-Assisted Mathematical Evaluation (LAME), an automated metric designed for mathematical formulations. Using LM4Opt-RA, Llama-3.1-70B achieved a LAME score of 0.8007, outperforming other models by a significant margin, followed closely by Llama-3.1-8B. While baseline LLMs demonstrate considerable promise, they still lag behind human expertise; our proposed method surpasses these baselines regarding LAME and other metrics.

- **Abstract**:
> Code generation has emerged as a critical research area at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies. Finally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities for future research endeavors in LLM-assisted hardware design.

## 129. Architect in the Loop Agentic Hardware Design and Verification
- **Authors**: Mubarek Mohammed
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00016](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00016)
- **Abstract**:
> The ever increasing complexity of the hardware design process demands improved hardware design and verification methodologies. With the advent of generative AI various attempts have been made to automate parts of the design and verification process. Large language models (LLMs) as well as specialized models generate hdl and testbenches for small components, having a few leaf level components. However, there are only a few attempts to automate the entire processor design process. Hardware design demands hierarchical and modular design processes. We utilized this best practice systematically and effectively. We propose agentic automated processor design and verification with engineers in the loop. The agent with optional specification tries to break down the design into sub-components, generate HDL and cocotb tests, and verifies the components involving engineer guidance, especially during debugging and synthesis. We designed various digital systems using this approach. However, we selected two simple processors for demonstration purposes in this work. The first one is a LEGv8 like a simple processor verified, synthesized and programmed for the DE-10 Lite FPGA. The second one is a RISC-V like 32-bit processor designed and verified in similar manner and synthesized. However, it is not programmed into the DE-10 Lite. This process is accomplished usually using around a million inference tokens per processor, using a combination of reasoning (e.g gemini-pro) and non-reasoning models (eg. gpt-5-mini) based on the complexity of the task. This indicates that hardware design and verification experimentation can be done cost effectively without using any specialized hardware. The approach is scalable, we even attempted system-on-chip, which we want to experiment in our future work.

- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents offer promising solutions for mental health support, but lack cultural responsiveness for diverse populations. This study evaluated the effectiveness of cultural prompting in improving cultural responsiveness and perceived empathy of LLM-generated therapeutic responses for Chinese American family caregivers. Using a randomized controlled experiment, we compared GPT-4o and Deepseek-V3 responses with and without cultural prompting. Thirty-six participants evaluated input-response pairs on cultural responsiveness (competence and relevance) and perceived empathy. Results showed that cultural prompting significantly enhanced GPT-4o's performance across all dimensions, with GPT-4o with cultural prompting being the most preferred, while improvements in DeepSeek-V3 responses were not significant. Mediation analysis revealed that cultural prompting improved empathy through improving cultural responsiveness. This study demonstrated that prompt-based techniques can effectively enhance the cultural responsiveness of LLM-generated therapeutic responses, highlighting the importance of cultural responsiveness in delivering empathetic AI-based therapeutic interventions to culturally and linguistically diverse populations.

- **Abstract**:
> The creative potential of computers has intrigued researchers for decades. Since the emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI), computer creativity has found many new dimensions and applications. As Gen AI permeates mainstream discourse and usage, researchers are delving into how it can improve and complement what humans do. Creative potential is a highly relevant notion to design practice and research, especially in the initial stages of ideation and conceptualisation. There is scope to improve creative potential in these stages, especially using machine intelligence. We propose a structured ideation session involving inspirational stimuli and utilise Gen AI in delivering this structure to designers through ALIA: Analogical LLM Ideation Agent, a tool for small-group ideation scenarios. The tool is developed by enabling speech based interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) for inference generation. Inspiration is drawn from the synectic ideation method and the dialectics philosophy to design the optimal stimuli in group ideation. The tool is tested in design ideation sessions to compare the output of the AI-assisted ideation sessions to that of tradi tional ideation sessions. Preliminary findings showcase that participants have rated their ideas better when assisted by ALIA and respond favourably to speech-based interactions.

- **Abstract**:
> Qualitative research emphasizes constructing meaning through iterative engagement with textual data. Traditionally this human-driven process requires navigating coder fatigue and interpretative drift, thus posing challenges when scaling analysis to larger, more complex datasets. Computational approaches to augment qualitative research have been met with skepticism, partly due to their inability to replicate the nuance, context-awareness, and sophistication of human analysis. Large language models, however, present new opportunities to automate aspects of qualitative analysis while upholding rigor and research quality in important ways. To assess their benefits and limitations - and build trust among qualitative researchers - these approaches must be rigorously benchmarked against human-generated datasets. In this work, we benchmark Muse, an interactive, AI-powered qualitative research system that allows researchers to identify themes and annotate datasets, finding an inter-rater reliability between Muse and humans of Cohen's $\kappa$ = 0.71 for well-specified codes. We also conduct robust error analysis to identify failure mode, guide future improvements, and demonstrate the capacity to correct for human bias.

- **Abstract**:
> The COVID-19 infodemic calls for scalable fact-checking solutions that handle long-form misinformation with accuracy and reliability. This study presents SAFE (system for accurate fact extraction and evaluation), an agent system that combines large language models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve automated fact-checking of long-form COVID-19 misinformation. SAFE includes two agents - one for claim extraction and another for claim verification using LOTR-RAG, which leverages a 130,000-document COVID-19 research corpus. An enhanced variant, SAFE (LOTR-RAG + SRAG), incorporates Self-RAG to refine retrieval via query rewriting. We evaluated both systems on 50 fake news articles (2-17 pages) containing 246 annotated claims (M = 4.922, SD = 3.186), labeled as true (14.1%), partly true (14.4%), false (27.0%), partly false (2.2%), and misleading (21.0%) by public health professionals. SAFE systems significantly outperformed baseline LLMs in all metrics (p < 0.001). For consistency (0-1 scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) scored 0.629, exceeding both SAFE (+SRAG) (0.577) and the baseline (0.279). In subjective evaluations (0-4 Likert scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) also achieved the highest average ratings in usefulness (3.640), clearness (3.800), and authenticity (3.526). Adding SRAG slightly reduced overall performance, except for a minor gain in clearness. SAFE demonstrates robust improvements in long-form COVID-19 fact-checking by addressing LLM limitations in consistency and explainability. The core LOTR-RAG design proved more effective than its SRAG-augmented variant, offering a strong foundation for scalable misinformation mitigation.

## 134. Enhancing Talent Search Ranking with Role-Aware Expert Mixtures and LLM-based Fine-Grained Job Descriptions

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00004](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00004)
- **Abstract**:
> Talent search is a cornerstone of modern recruitment systems, yet existing approaches often struggle to capture nuanced job-specific preferences, model recruiter behavior at a fine-grained level, and mitigate noise from subjective human judgments. We present a novel framework that enhances talent search effectiveness and delivers substantial business value through two key innovations: (i) leveraging LLMs to extract fine-grained recruitment signals from job descriptions and historical hiring data, and (ii) employing a role-aware multi-gate MoE network to capture behavioral differences across recruiter roles. To further reduce noise, we introduce a multi-task learning module that jointly optimizes click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), and resume matching relevance. Experiments on real-world recruitment data and online A/B testing show relative AUC gains of 1.70% (CTR) and 5.97% (CVR), and a 17.29% lift in click-through conversion rate. These improvements reduce dependence on external sourcing channels, enabling an estimated annual cost saving of millions of CNY.
