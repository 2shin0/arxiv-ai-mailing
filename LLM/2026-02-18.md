## 2. This human study did not involve human subjects: Validating LLM simulations as behavioral evidence
- **Authors**: Jessica Hullman , David Broska , Huaman Sun , Aaron Shaw
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15785](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15785)
- **Abstract**:
> A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations. We consider what opportunities are overlooked when researchers focus myopically on substituting LLMs for human participants in a study.

## 3. Recursive Concept Evolution for Compositional Reasoning in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Sarim Chaudhry
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15725](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15725)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models achieve strong performance on many complex reasoning tasks, yet their accuracy degrades sharply on benchmarks that require compositional reasoning, including ARC-AGI-2, GPQA, MATH, BBH, and HLE. Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE.

## 4. PERSONA: Dynamic and Compositional Inference-Time Personality Control via Activation Vector Algebra
- **Authors**: Xiachong Feng , Liang Zhao , Weihong Zhong , Yichong Huang , Yuxuan Gu , Lingpeng Kong , Xiaocheng Feng , Bing Qin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15669)
- **Abstract**:
> Current methods for personality control in Large Language Models rely on static prompting or expensive fine-tuning, failing to capture the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits. We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control.

- **Authors**: Lucas Elbert Suryana , Farah Bierenga , Sanne van Buuren , Pepijn Kooij , Elsefien Tulleners , Federico Scari , Simeon Calvert , Bart van Arem , Arkady Zgonnikov
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15645](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15645)
- **Abstract**:
> Foundation models, including vision language models, are increasingly used in automated driving to interpret scenes, recommend actions, and generate natural language explanations. However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.

## 6. Quantifying construct validity in large language model evaluations
- **Authors**: Ryan Othniel Kearns
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15532](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15532)
- **Abstract**:
> The LLM community often reports benchmark results as if they are synonymous with general model capabilities. However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance. Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks. This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.

## 7. GenAI-LA: Generative AI and Learning Analytics Workshop (LAK 2026), April 27--May 1, 2026, Bergen, Norway
- **Authors**: Javier Irigoyen , Roberto Daza , Aythami Morales , Julian Fierrez , Francisco Jurado , Alvaro Ortigosa , Ruben Tolosana
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15531](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15531)
- **Abstract**:
> This work introduces EduEVAL-DB, a dataset based on teacher roles designed to support the evaluation and training of automatic pedagogical evaluators and AI tutors for instructional explanations. The dataset comprises 854 explanations corresponding to 139 questions from a curated subset of the ScienceQA benchmark, spanning science, language, and social science across K-12 grade levels. For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation. We benchmark a state-of-the-art education-oriented model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) against a lightweight local Llama 3.1 8B model and examine whether supervised fine-tuning on EduEVAL-DB supports pedagogical risk detection using models deployable on consumer hardware.

## 8. Improving LLM Reliability through Hybrid Abstention and Adaptive Detection
- **Authors**: Ankit Sharma , Nachiket Tapas , Jyotiprakash Patra
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15391](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15391)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in production environments face a fundamental safety-utility trade-off either a strict filtering mechanisms prevent harmful outputs but often block benign queries or a relaxed controls risk unsafe content generation. Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment.

## 9. World-Model-Augmented Web Agents with Action Correction
- **Authors**: Zhouzhou Shen , Xueyu Hu , Xiyun Li , Tianqing Fang , Juncheng Li , Shengyu Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15384](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15384)
- **Abstract**:
> Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.

## 10. AgriWorld:A World Tools Protocol Framework for Verifiable Agricultural Reasoning with Code-Executing LLM Agents
- **Authors**: Zhixing Zhang , Jesen Zhang , Hao Liu , Qinhan Lv , Jing Yang , Kaitong Cai , Keze Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15325](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15325)
- **Abstract**:
> Foundation models for agriculture are increasingly trained on massive spatiotemporal data (e.g., multi-spectral remote sensing, soil grids, and field-level management logs) and achieve strong performance on forecasting and monitoring. However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual "what-if" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning.

- **Authors**: Ming Du , Yanqi Luo , Srutarshi Banerjee , Michael Wojcik , Jelena Popovic , Mathew J. Cherukara
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15294](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15294)
- **Abstract**:
> We present Experiment Automation Agents (EAA), a vision-language-model-driven agentic system designed to automate complex experimental microscopy workflows. EAA integrates multimodal reasoning, tool-augmented action, and optional long-term memory to support both autonomous procedures and interactive user-guided measurements. Built on a flexible task-manager architecture, the system enables workflows ranging from fully agent-driven automation to logic-defined routines that embed localized LLM queries. EAA further provides a modern tool ecosystem with two-way compatibility for Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing instrument-control tools to be consumed or served across applications. We demonstrate EAA at an imaging beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, including automated zone plate focusing, natural language-described feature search, and interactive data acquisition. These results illustrate how vision-capable agents can enhance beamline efficiency, reduce operational burden, and lower the expertise barrier for users.

## 12. Secure and Energy-Efficient Wireless Agentic AI Networks
- **Authors**: Yuanyan Song , Kezhi Wang , Xinmian Xu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15212](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15212)
- **Abstract**:
> In this paper, we introduce a secure wireless agentic AI network comprising one supervisor AI agent and multiple other AI agents to provision quality of service (QoS) for users' reasoning tasks while ensuring confidentiality of private knowledge and reasoning outcomes. Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are validated using a practical agentic AI system based on Qwen, demonstrating satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks.

## 13. Mind the (DH) Gap! A Contrast in Risky Choices Between Reasoning and Conversational LLMs
- **Authors**: Luise Ge , Yongyan Zhang , Yevgeniy Vorobeychik
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15173)
- **Abstract**:
> The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning.

## 14. Panini: Continual Learning in Token Space via Structured Memory
- **Authors**: Shreyas Rajesh , Pavan Holur , Mehmet Yigit Turali , Chenda Duan , Vwani Roychowdhury
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15156](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15156)
- **Abstract**:
> Language models are increasingly used to reason over content they were not trained on, such as new documents, evolving knowledge, and user-specific data. A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

## 15. Protecting Language Models Against Unauthorized Distillation through Trace Rewriting
- **Authors**: Xinhang Ma , William Yeoh , Ning Zhang , Yevgeniy Vorobeychik
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15143](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15143)
- **Abstract**:
> Knowledge distillation is a widely adopted technique for transferring capabilities from LLMs to smaller, more efficient student models. However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms.

## 16. ResearchGym: Evaluating Language Model Agents on Real-World AI Research
- **Authors**: Aniketh Garikaparthi , Manasi Patwardhan , Arman Cohan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15112](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15112)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce ResearchGym, a benchmark and execution environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research. To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research.

## 17. CrispEdit: Low-Curvature Projections for Scalable Non-Destructive LLM Editing
- **Authors**: Zarif Ikram , Arad Firouzkouhi , Stephen Tu , Mahdi Soltanolkotabi , Paria Rashidinejad
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15823](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15823)
- **Abstract**:
> A central challenge in large language model (LLM) editing is capability preservation: methods that successfully change targeted behavior can quietly game the editing proxy and corrupt general capabilities, producing degenerate behaviors reminiscent of proxy/reward hacking. We present CrispEdit, a scalable and principled second-order editing algorithm that treats capability preservation as an explicit constraint, unifying and generalizing several existing editing approaches. CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the Gauss-Newton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and a novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices. Across standard model-editing benchmarks, CrispEdit achieves high edit success while keeping capability degradation below 1% on average across datasets, significantly improving over prior editors.

## 18. Decision Quality Evaluation Framework at Pinterest
- **Authors**: Yuqi Tian , Robert Paine , Attila Dobi , Kevin O'Sullivan , Aravindh Manickavasagam , Faisal Farooq
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15809](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15809)
- **Abstract**:
> Online platforms require robust systems to enforce content safety policies at scale. A critical component of these systems is the ability to evaluate the quality of moderation decisions made by both human agents and Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this evaluation is challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between cost, scale, and trustworthiness, along with the complexity of evolving policies. To address this, we present a comprehensive Decision Quality Evaluation Framework developed and deployed at Pinterest. The framework is centered on a high-trust Golden Set (GDS) curated by subject matter experts (SMEs), which serves as a ground truth benchmark. We introduce an automated intelligent sampling pipeline that uses propensity scores to efficiently expand dataset coverage. We demonstrate the framework's practical application in several key areas: benchmarking the cost-performance trade-offs of various LLM agents, establishing a rigorous methodology for data-driven prompt optimization, managing complex policy evolution, and ensuring the integrity of policy content prevalence metrics via continuous validation. The framework enables a shift from subjective assessments to a data-driven and quantitative practice for managing content safety systems.

## 19. The Geometry of Alignment Collapse: When Fine-Tuning Breaks Safety
- **Authors**: Max Springer , Chung Peng Lee , Blossom Metevier , Jane Castleman , Bohdan Turbal , Hayoung Jung , Zeyu Shen , Aleksandra Korolova
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15799](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15799)
- **Abstract**:
> Fine-tuning aligned language models on benign tasks unpredictably degrades safety guardrails, even when training data contains no harmful content and developers have no adversarial intent. We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters. These results expose a structural blind spot in the current safety paradigm. The dominant approaches to safe fine-tuning address only the initial snapshot of a fundamentally dynamic problem. Alignment fragility is not a bug to be patched; it is an intrinsic geometric property of gradient descent on curved manifolds. Our results motivate the development of curvature-aware methods, and we hope will further enable a shift in alignment safety analysis from reactive red-teaming to predictive diagnostics for open-weight model deployment.

## 20. ChartEditBench: Evaluating Grounded Multi-Turn Chart Editing in Multimodal Language Models
- **Authors**: Manav Nitin Kapadnis , Lawanya Baghel , Atharva Naik , Carolyn Rosé
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15758](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15758)
- **Abstract**:
> While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform strongly on single-turn chart generation, their ability to support real-world exploratory data analysis remains underexplored. In practice, users iteratively refine visualizations through multi-turn interactions that require maintaining common ground, tracking prior edits, and adapting to evolving preferences. We introduce ChartEditBench, a benchmark for incremental, visually grounded chart editing via code, comprising 5,000 difficulty-controlled modification chains and a rigorously human-verified subset. Unlike prior one-shot benchmarks, ChartEditBench evaluates sustained, context-aware editing. We further propose a robust evaluation framework that mitigates limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge metrics by integrating execution-based fidelity checks, pixel-level visual similarity, and logical code verification. Experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal substantial degradation in multi-turn settings due to error accumulation and breakdowns in shared context, with strong performance on stylistic edits but frequent execution failures on data-centric transformations. ChartEditBench, establishes a challenging testbed for grounded, intent-aware multimodal programming.

## 21. Learning to Retrieve Navigable Candidates for Efficient Vision-and-Language Navigation
- **Authors**: Shutian Gu , Chengkai Huang , Ruoyu Wang , Lina Yao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15724](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15724)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.

## 22. A Content-Based Framework for Cybersecurity Refusal Decisions in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Meirav Segal , Noa Linder , Omer Antverg , Gil Gekker , Tomer Fichman , Omri Bodenheimer , Edan Maor , Omer Nevo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15689](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15689)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models and LLM-based agents are increasingly used for cybersecurity tasks that are inherently dual-use. Existing approaches to refusal, spanning academic policy frameworks and commercially deployed systems, often rely on broad topic-based bans or offensive-focused taxonomies. As a result, they can yield inconsistent decisions, over-restrict legitimate defenders, and behave brittlely under obfuscation or request segmentation. We argue that effective refusal requires explicitly modeling the trade-off between offensive risk and defensive benefit, rather than relying solely on intent or offensive classification. In this paper, we introduce a content-based framework for designing and auditing cyber refusal policies that makes offense-defense tradeoffs explicit. The framework characterizes requests along five dimensions: Offensive Action Contribution, Offensive Risk, Technical Complexity, Defensive Benefit, and Expected Frequency for Legitimate Users, grounded in the technical substance of the request rather than stated intent. We demonstrate that this content-grounded approach resolves inconsistencies in current frontier model behavior and allows organizations to construct tunable, risk-aware refusal policies.

## 23. Revisiting Northrop Frye's Four Myths Theory with Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Edirlei Soares de Lima , Marco A. Casanova , Antonio L. Furtado
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15678](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15678)
- **Abstract**:
> Northrop Frye's theory of four fundamental narrative genres (comedy, romance, tragedy, satire) has profoundly influenced literary criticism, yet computational approaches to his framework have focused primarily on narrative patterns rather than character functions. In this paper, we present a new character function framework that complements pattern-based analysis by examining how archetypal roles manifest differently across Frye's genres. Drawing on Jungian archetype theory, we derive four universal character functions (protagonist, mentor, antagonist, companion) by mapping them to Jung's psychic structure components. These functions are then specialized into sixteen genre-specific roles based on prototypical works. To validate this framework, we conducted a multi-model study using six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate character-role correspondences across 40 narrative works. The validation employed both positive samples (160 valid correspondences) and negative samples (30 invalid correspondences) to evaluate whether models both recognize valid correspondences and reject invalid ones. LLMs achieved substantial performance (mean balanced accuracy of 82.5%) with strong inter-model agreement (Fleiss' $\kappa$ = 0.600), demonstrating that the proposed correspondences capture systematic structural patterns. Performance varied by genre (ranging from 72.7% to 89.9%) and role (52.5% to 99.2%), with qualitative analysis revealing that variations reflect genuine narrative properties, including functional distribution in romance and deliberate archetypal subversion in satire. This character-based approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-supported methods for computational narratology and provides a foundation for future development of narrative generation methods and interactive storytelling applications.

## 24. Zombie Agents: Persistent Control of Self-Evolving LLM Agents via Self-Reinforcing Injections
- **Authors**: Xianglin Yang , Yufei He , Shuo Ji , Bryan Hooi , Jin Song Dong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15654)
- **Abstract**:
> Self-evolving LLM agents update their internal state across sessions, often by writing and reusing long-term memory. This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker. We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15620](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15620)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly improved large language model reasoning, but existing RL fine-tuning methods rely heavily on heuristic techniques such as entropy regularization and reweighting to maintain stability. In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. We derive that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01\%, which we term \emph{spurious tokens}. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates. Motivated by this observation, we propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO) for large-scale model refining, which selectively masks such updates and renormalizes the loss over valid tokens. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Qwen 1.7B, 8B, and 14B base models, STAPO consistently demonstrates superior entropy stability and achieves an average performance improvement of 7.13\% over GRPO, 20-Entropy and JustRL.

## 26. The geometry of online conversations and the causal antecedents of conflictual discourse
- **Authors**: Carlo Santagiustina , Caterina Cruciani
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15600](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15600)
- **Abstract**:
> This article investigates the causal antecedents of conflictual language and the geometry of interaction in online threaded conversations related to climate change. We employ three annotation dimensions, inferred through LLM prompting and averaging, to capture complementary aspects of discursive conflict (such as stance: agreement vs disagreement; tone: attacking vs respectful; and emotional versus factual framing) and use data from a threaded online forum to examine how these dimensions respond to temporal, conversational, and arborescent structural features of discussions. We show that, as suggested by the literature, longer delays between successive posts in a thread are associated with replies that are, on average, more respectful, whereas longer delays relative to the parent post are associated with slightly less disagreement but more emotional (less factual) language. Second, we characterize alignment with the local conversational environment and find strong convergence both toward the average stance, tone and emotional framing of older sibling posts replying to the same parent and toward those of the parent post itself, with parent post effects generally stronger than sibling effects. We further show that early branch-level responses condition these alignment dynamics, such that parent-child stance alignment is amplified or attenuated depending on whether a branch is initiated in agreement or disagreement with the discussion's root message. These influences are largely additive for civility-related dimensions (attacking vs respectful, disagree vs agree), whereas for emotional versus factual framing there is a significant interaction: alignment with the parent's emotionality is amplified when older siblings are similarly aligned.

## 27. VLM-DEWM: Dynamic External World Model for Verifiable and Resilient Vision-Language Planning in Manufacturing
- **Authors**: Guoqin Tang , Qingxuan Jia , Gang Chen , Tong Li , Zeyuan Huang , Zihang Lv , Ning Ji
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15549)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-language model (VLM) shows promise for high-level planning in smart manufacturing, yet their deployment in dynamic workcells faces two critical challenges: (1) stateless operation, they cannot persistently track out-of-view states, causing world-state drift; and (2) opaque reasoning, failures are difficult to diagnose, leading to costly blind retries. This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments.

## 28. Improving MLLMs in Embodied Exploration and Question Answering with Human-Inspired Memory Modeling
- **Authors**: Ji Li , Jing Xia , Mingyi Li , Shiyan Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15513](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15513)
- **Abstract**:
> Deploying Multimodal Large Language Models as the brain of embodied agents remains challenging, particularly under long-horizon observations and limited context budgets. Existing memory assisted methods often rely on textual summaries, which discard rich visual and spatial details and remain brittle in non-stationary environments. In this work, we propose a non-parametric memory framework that explicitly disentangles episodic and semantic memory for embodied exploration and question answering. Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on embodied question answering and exploration benchmarks, yielding a 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and an 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA, as well as +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench. Analyses reveal that our episodic memory primarily improves exploration efficiency, while semantic memory strengthens complex reasoning of embodied agents.

- **Abstract**:
> We introduce SecCodeBench-V2, a publicly released benchmark for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) copilots' capabilities of generating secure code. SecCodeBench-V2 comprises 98 generation and fix scenarios derived from Alibaba Group's industrial productions, where the underlying security issues span 22 common CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) categories across five programming languages: Java, C, Python, Go, and this http URL . SecCodeBench-V2 adopts a function-level task formulation: each scenario provides a complete project scaffold and requires the model to implement or patch a designated target function under fixed interfaces and dependencies. For each scenario, SecCodeBench-V2 provides executable proof-of-concept (PoC) test cases for both functional validation and security verification. All test cases are authored and double-reviewed by security experts, ensuring high fidelity, broad coverage, and reliable ground truth. Beyond the benchmark itself, we build a unified evaluation pipeline that assesses models primarily via dynamic execution. For most scenarios, we compile and run model-generated artifacts in isolated environments and execute PoC test cases to validate both functional correctness and security properties. For scenarios where security issues cannot be adjudicated with deterministic test cases, we additionally employ an LLM-as-a-judge oracle. To summarize performance across heterogeneous scenarios and difficulty levels, we design a Pass@K-based scoring protocol with principled aggregation over scenarios and severity, enabling holistic and comparable evaluation across models. Overall, SecCodeBench-V2 provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for assessing the security posture of AI coding assistants, with results and artifacts released at this https URL . The benchmark is publicly available at this https URL .

## 30. Logit Distance Bounds Representational Similarity
- **Authors**: Beatrix M. B. Nielsen , Emanuele Marconato , Luigi Gresele , Andrea Dittadi , Simon Buchholz
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15438](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15438)
- **Abstract**:
> For a broad family of discriminative models that includes autoregressive language models, identifiability results imply that if two models induce the same conditional distributions, then their internal representations agree up to an invertible linear transformation. We ask whether an analogous conclusion holds approximately when the distributions are close instead of equal. Building on the observation of Nielsen et al. (2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts. In distillation experiments on synthetic and image datasets, logit-distance distillation yields students with higher linear representational similarity and better preservation of the teacher's linearly recoverable concepts.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15397)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leveraging the native autoregressive paradigm of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated superior instruction-following and training efficiency. Central to this paradigm is action tokenization, yet its design has primarily focused on reconstruction fidelity, failing to address its direct impact on VLA optimization. Consequently, the fundamental question of \textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks. Notably, on LIBERO, a SmolVLM2-2.2B fine-tuned with ActionCodec achieves a 95.5\% success rate without any robotics pre-training. With advanced architectural enhancements, this reaches 97.4\%, representing a new SOTA for VLA models without robotics pre-training. We believe our established design principles, alongside the released model, will provide a clear roadmap for the community to develop more effective action tokenizers.

- **Authors**: Mengze Hong , Chen Jason Zhang , Zichang Guo , Hanlin Gu , Di Jiang , Li Qing
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15377](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15377)
- **Abstract**:
> Customer service automation has seen growing demand within digital transformation. Existing approaches either rely on modular system designs with extensive agent orchestration or employ over-simplified instruction schemas, providing limited guidance and poor generalizability. This paper introduces an orchestration-free framework using Task-Oriented Flowcharts (TOFs) to enable end-to-end automation without manual intervention. We first define the components and evaluation metrics for TOFs, then formalize a cost-efficient flowchart construction algorithm to abstract procedural knowledge from service dialogues. We emphasize local deployment of small language models and propose decentralized distillation with flowcharts to mitigate data scarcity and privacy issues in model training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness in various service tasks, with superior quantitative and application performance compared to strong baselines and market products. By releasing a web-based system demonstration with case studies, we aim to promote streamlined creation of future service automation.

- **Authors**: Deniz Kaya Dilsiz , Dipankar Srirag , Aditya Joshi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15373](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15373)
- **Abstract**:
> Language models exhibit systematic performance gaps when processing text in non-standard language varieties, yet their ability to comprehend variety-specific slang remains underexplored for several languages. We present a comprehensive evaluation of slang awareness in Indian English (en-IN) and Australian English (en-AU) across seven state-of-the-art language models. We construct two complementary datasets: \textsc{web}, containing 377 web-sourced usage examples from Urban Dictionary, and \textsc{gen}, featuring 1,492 synthetically generated usages of these slang terms, across diverse scenarios. We assess language models on three tasks: target word prediction (TWP), guided target word prediction (TWP$^*$) and target word selection (TWS). Our results reveal four key findings: (1) Higher average model performance TWS versus TWP and TWP$^*$, with average accuracy score increasing from 0.03 to 0.49 respectively (2) Stronger average model performance on \textsc{web} versus \textsc{gen} datasets, with average similarity score increasing by 0.03 and 0.05 across TWP and TWP$^*$ tasks respectively (3) en-IN tasks outperform en-AU when averaged across all models and datasets, with TWS demonstrating the largest disparity, increasing average accuracy from 0.44 to 0.54. These findings underscore fundamental asymmetries between generative and discriminative competencies for variety-specific language, particularly in the context of slang expressions despite being in a technologically rich language such as English.

## 34. GMAIL: Generative Modality Alignment for generated Image Learning
- **Authors**: Shentong Mo , Sukmin Yun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15368](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15368)
- **Abstract**:
> Generative models have made it possible to synthesize highly realistic images, potentially providing an abundant data source for training machine learning models. Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.

## 35. Automated Multi-Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation for Dashboard Applications
- **Authors**: Devendra Tata , Mona Rajhans
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15362](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15362)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern web dashboards and enterprise applications increasingly rely on complex, distributed microservices architectures. While these architectures offer scalability, they introduce significant challenges in debugging and observability. When failures occur, they often manifest as opaque error messages to the end-user such as Something went wrong. This masks the underlying root cause which may reside in browser side exceptions, API contract violations, or server side logic failures. Existing monitoring tools capture these events in isolation but fail to correlate them effectively or provide intelligible explanations to non technical users. This paper proposes a novel system for Automated Multi Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation. The proposed framework automatically collects and correlates error data from disparate sources such as browser, API, server logs and validates API contracts in real time, and utilizes Large Language Models to generate natural language explanations. This approach significantly reduces Mean Time to Resolution for support engineers and improves the user experience by transforming cryptic error codes into actionable insights.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15353](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15353)
- **Abstract**:
> Large pretrained language models and neural reasoning systems have advanced many natural language tasks, yet they remain challenged by knowledge-intensive queries that require precise, structured multi-hop inference. Knowledge graphs provide a compact symbolic substrate for factual grounding, but integrating graph structure with neural models is nontrivial: naively embedding graph facts into prompts leads to inefficiency and fragility, while purely symbolic or search-heavy approaches can be costly in retrievals and lack gradient-based refinement. We introduce NeuroSymActive, a modular framework that combines a differentiable neural-symbolic reasoning layer with an active, value-guided exploration controller for Knowledge Graph Question Answering. The method couples soft-unification style symbolic modules with a neural path evaluator and a Monte-Carlo style exploration policy that prioritizes high-value path expansions. Empirical results on standard KGQA benchmarks show that NeuroSymActive attains strong answer accuracy while reducing the number of expensive graph lookups and model calls compared to common retrieval-augmented baselines.

## 37. Fine-Tuning LLMs to Generate Economical and Reliable Actions for the Power Grid
- **Authors**: Mohamad Chehade , Hao Zhu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15350](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15350)
- **Abstract**:
> Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) force rapid topology changes that can render standard operating points infeasible, requiring operators to quickly identify corrective transmission switching actions that reduce load shedding while maintaining acceptable voltage behavior. We present a verifiable, multi-stage adaptation pipeline that fine-tunes an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) to generate \emph{open-only} corrective switching plans from compact PSPS scenario summaries under an explicit switching budget. First, supervised fine-tuning distills a DC-OPF MILP oracle into a constrained action grammar that enables reliable parsing and feasibility checks. Second, direct preference optimization refines the policy using AC-evaluated preference pairs ranked by a voltage-penalty metric, injecting voltage-awareness beyond DC imitation. Finally, best-of-$N$ selection provides an inference-time addition by choosing the best feasible candidate under the target metric. On IEEE 118-bus PSPS scenarios, fine-tuning substantially improves DC objective values versus zero-shot generation, reduces AC power-flow failure from 50\% to single digits, and improves voltage-penalty outcomes on the common-success set. Code and data-generation scripts are released to support reproducibility.

## 38. Prescriptive Scaling Reveals the Evolution of Language Model Capabilities
- **Authors**: Hanlin Zhang , Jikai Jin , Vasilis Syrgkanis , Sham Kakade
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15327](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15327)
- **Abstract**:
> For deploying foundation models, practitioners increasingly need prescriptive scaling laws: given a pre training compute budget, what downstream accuracy is attainable with contemporary post training practice, and how stable is that mapping as the field evolves? Using large scale observational evaluations with 5k observational and 2k newly sampled data on model performance, we estimate capability boundaries, high conditional quantiles of benchmark scores as a function of log pre training FLOPs, via smoothed quantile regression with a monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task dependent saturation and to probe contamination related shifts on math reasoning tasks. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm that recovers near full data frontiers using roughly 20% of evaluation budget. Together, our work releases the Proteus 2k, the latest model performance evaluation dataset, and introduces a practical methodology for translating compute budgets into reliable performance expectations and for monitoring when capability boundaries shift across time.

## 39. Unforgeable Watermarks for Language Models via Robust Signatures
- **Authors**: Huijia Lin , Kameron Shahabi , Min Jae Song
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15323)
- **Abstract**:
> Language models now routinely produce text that is difficult to distinguish from human writing, raising the need for robust tools to verify content provenance. Watermarking has emerged as a promising countermeasure, with existing work largely focused on model quality preservation and robust detection. However, current schemes provide limited protection against false attribution. We strengthen the notion of soundness by introducing two novel guarantees: unforgeability and recoverability. Unforgeability prevents adversaries from crafting false positives, texts that are far from any output from the watermarked model but are nonetheless flagged as watermarked. Recoverability provides an additional layer of protection: whenever a watermark is detected, the detector identifies the source text from which the flagged content was derived. Together, these properties strengthen content ownership by linking content exclusively to its generating model, enabling secure attribution and fine-grained traceability. We construct the first undetectable watermarking scheme that is robust, unforgeable, and recoverable with respect to substitutions (i.e., perturbations in Hamming metric). The key technical ingredient is a new cryptographic primitive called robust (or recoverable) digital signatures, which allow verification of messages that are close to signed ones, while preventing forgery of messages that are far from all previously signed messages. We show that any standard digital signature scheme can be boosted to a robust one using property-preserving hash functions (Boyle, LaVigne, and Vaikuntanathan, ITCS 2019).

## 40. On Surprising Effectiveness of Masking Updates in Adaptive Optimizers
- **Authors**: Taejong Joo , Wenhan Xia , Cheolmin Kim , Ming Zhang , Eugene Ie
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15322](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15322)
- **Abstract**:
> Training large language models (LLMs) relies almost exclusively on dense adaptive optimizers with increasingly sophisticated preconditioners. We challenge this by showing that randomly masking parameter updates can be highly effective, with a masked variant of RMSProp consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art optimizers. Our analysis reveals that the random masking induces a curvature-dependent geometric regularization that smooths the optimization trajectory. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Momentum-aligned gradient masking (Magma), which modulates the masked updates using momentum-gradient alignment. Extensive LLM pre-training experiments show that Magma is a simple drop-in replacement for adaptive optimizers with consistent gains and negligible computational overhead. Notably, for the 1B model size, Magma reduces perplexity by over 19\% and 9\% compared to Adam and Muon, respectively.

## 41. Sparrow: Text-Anchored Window Attention with Visual-Semantic Glimpsing for Speculative Decoding in Video LLMs
- **Authors**: Libo Zhang , Zhaoning Zhang , Wangyang Hong , Peng Qiao , Dongsheng Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15318](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15318)
- **Abstract**:
> Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

## 42. Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models?
- **Authors**: Manuel Cherep , Pranav M R , Pattie Maes , Nikhil Singh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15278)
- **Abstract**:
> The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.

## 43. How to Train Your Long-Context Visual Document Model
- **Authors**: Austin Veselka
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15257](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15257)
- **Abstract**:
> We present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of training long-context vision language models up to 344K context, targeting long-document visual question answering with measured transfer to long-context text. While several such strong are open-weight, namely Qwen3 VL and GLM 4.5/6V, their training recipes and data pipelines are not reproducible. We systematically study continued pretraining, supervised finetuning, and preference optimization for 24B and 32B parameter models, backed by extensive LC evaluations and ablations to bridge this gap, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBenchDoc for both parameter scales. In addition to this, our key findings include: (i) training on context lengths that match evaluation context lengths outperforms training on longer contexts, (ii) training and evaluating with page indices provides a simple, high-impact boost to long-document performance, (iii) our synthetic data pipelines enable self-improvement via continued pretraining and supervised finetuning, and (iv) we extend the known text-to-visual long context transfer to the reverse, showing that visual long context training transfers to long-context text performance. We also release MMLBD-C, a manually corrected version of MMLongBenchDoc to reduce erroneous and low quality examples in the benchmark.

## 44. Automatically Finding Reward Model Biases
- **Authors**: Atticus Wang , Iván Arcuschin , Arthur Conmy
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15222](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15222)
- **Abstract**:
> Reward models are central to large language model (LLM) post-training. However, past work has shown that they can reward spurious or undesirable attributes such as length, format, hallucinations, and sycophancy. In this work, we introduce and study the research problem of automatically finding reward model biases in natural language. We offer a simple approach of using an LLM to iteratively propose and refine candidate biases. Our method can recover known biases and surface novel ones: for example, we found that Skywork-V2-8B, a leading open-weight reward model, often mistakenly favors responses with redundant spacing and responses with hallucinated content. In addition, we show evidence that evolutionary iteration outperforms flat best-of-N search, and we validate the recall of our pipeline using synthetically injected biases. We hope our work contributes to further research on improving RMs through automated interpretability methods.

- **Abstract**:
> Multi-agent systems, where LLM agents communicate through free-form language, enable sophisticated coordination for solving complex cooperative tasks. This surfaces a unique safety problem when individual agents form a coalition and \emph{collude} to pursue secondary goals and degrade the joint objective. In this paper, we present Colosseum, a framework for auditing LLM agents' collusive behavior in multi-agent settings. We ground how agents cooperate through a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) and measure collusion via regret relative to the cooperative optimum. Colosseum tests each LLM for collusion under different objectives, persuasion tactics, and network topologies. Through our audit, we show that most out-of-the-box models exhibited a propensity to collude when a secret communication channel was artificially formed. Furthermore, we discover ``collusion on paper'' when agents plan to collude in text but would often pick non-collusive actions, thus providing little effect on the joint task. Colosseum provides a new way to study collusion by measuring communications and actions in rich yet verifiable environments.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15197](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15197)
- **Abstract**:
> Tool-calling is essential for Large Language Model (LLM) agents to complete real-world tasks. While most existing benchmarks assume simple, perfectly documented tools, real-world tools (e.g., general "search" APIs) are often opaque, lacking clear best practices or failure modes. Can LLM agents improve their performance in environments with opaque tools by interacting and subsequently improving documentation? To study this, we create OpaqueToolsBench, a benchmark consisting of three distinct task-oriented environments: general function calling, interactive chess playing, and long-trajectory agentic search. Each environment provides underspecified tools that models must learn to use effectively to complete the task. Results on OpaqueToolsBench suggest existing methods for automatically documenting tools are expensive and unreliable when tools are opaque. To address this, we propose a simple framework, ToolObserver, that iteratively refines tool documentation by observing execution feedback from tool-calling trajectories. Our approach outperforms existing methods on OpaqueToolsBench across datasets, even in relatively hard settings. Furthermore, for test-time tool exploration settings, our method is also efficient, consuming 3.5-7.5x fewer total tokens than the best baseline.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15195](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15195)
- **Abstract**:
> LoRA adapters let users fine-tune large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, LoRA adapters are shared through open repositories like Hugging Face Hub \citep{huggingface_hub_docs}, making them vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Current detection methods require running the model with test input data -- making them impractical for screening thousands of adapters where the trigger for backdoor behavior is unknown. We detect poisoned adapters by analyzing their weight matrices directly, without running the model -- making our method data-agnostic. Our method extracts simple statistics -- how concentrated the singular values are, their entropy, and the distribution shape -- and flags adapters that deviate from normal patterns. We evaluate the method on 500 LoRA adapters -- 400 clean, and 100 poisoned for Llama-3.2-3B on instruction and reasoning datasets: Alpaca, Dolly, GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, SQuADv2, NaturalQuestions, HumanEval, and GLUE dataset. We achieve 97\% detection accuracy with less than 2\% false positives.

- **Authors**: William Brach , Francesco Zuppichini , Marco Vinciguerra , Lorenzo Padoan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15189](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15189)
- **Abstract**:
> The use of large language models for web information extraction is becoming increasingly fundamental to modern web information retrieval pipelines. However, existing datasets tend to be small, synthetic or text-only, failing to capture the structural context of the web. We introduce ScrapeGraphAI-100k, a large-scale dataset comprising real-world LLM extraction events, collected via opt-in ScrapeGraphAI telemetry during Q2 and Q3 of 2025. Starting from 9M events, we deduplicate and balance by schema to produce 93,695 examples spanning diverse domains and languages. Each instance includes Markdown content, a prompt, a JSON schema, the LLM response, and complexity/validation metadata. We characterize the datasets structural diversity and its failure modes as schema complexity increases. We also provide a fine-tuning experiment showing that a small language model (1.7B) trained on a subset narrows the gap to larger baselines (30B), underscoring the datasets utility for efficient extraction. ScrapeGraphAI-100k enables fine-tuning small models, benchmarking structured extraction, and studying schema induction for web IR indexing, and is publicly available on HuggingFace.

## 49. Beyond Context Sharing: A Unified Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) for Secure, Federated, and Autonomous Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Orchestration
- **Authors**: Naveen Kumar Krishnan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15055](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15055)
- **Abstract**:
> In the artificial intelligence space, as we transition from isolated large language models to autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. While foundational architectures and local context management protocols have been established, the challenge of cross-platform, decentralized, and secure interaction remains a significant barrier to the realization of a truly Agentic Web. Building upon the foundations of AI agent architectures and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for multi-agent coordination, this paper introduces the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). ACP provides a standardized framework for Agent-to-Agent (AA) interaction, enabling heterogeneous agents to discover, negotiate, and execute collaborative workflows across disparate environments. We propose a federated orchestration model that integrates decentralized identity verification, semantic intent mapping, and automated service-level agreements. Our evaluation demonstrates that ACP reduces inter-agent communication latency by % while maintaining a zero-trust security posture. This work represents a critical advancement toward a scalable and interoperable ecosystem of autonomous digital entities

## 50. Indic-TunedLens: Interpreting Multilingual Models in Indian Languages
- **Authors**: Mihir Panchal , Deeksha Varshney , Mamta , Asif Ekbal
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15038](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15038)
- **Abstract**:
> Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in linguistically diverse regions like India, yet most interpretability tools remain tailored to English. Prior work reveals that LLMs often operate in English centric representation spaces, making cross lingual interpretability a pressing concern. We introduce Indic-TunedLens, a novel interpretability framework specifically for Indian languages that learns shared affine transformations. Unlike the standard Logit Lens, which directly decodes intermediate activations, Indic-TunedLens adjusts hidden states for each target language, aligning them with the target output distributions to enable more faithful decoding of model representations. We evaluate our framework on 10 Indian languages using the MMLU benchmark and find that it significantly improves over SOTA interpretability methods, especially for morphologically rich, low resource languages. Our results provide crucial insights into the layer-wise semantic encoding of multilingual transformers. Our model is available at this https URL . Our code is available at this https URL .

## 51. CircuChain: Disentangling Competence and Compliance in LLM Circuit Analysis
- **Authors**: Mayank Ravishankara
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15037](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15037)
- **Abstract**:
> As large language models (LLMs) advance toward expert-level performance in engineering domains, reliable reasoning under user-specified constraints becomes critical. In circuit analysis, for example, a numerically correct solution is insufficient if it violates established methodological conventions such as mesh directionality or polarity assignments, errors that can propagate in safety-critical systems. Yet it remains unclear whether frontier models truly apply first-principles reasoning or rely on entrenched training priors that conflict with explicit instructions. We introduce CircuChain, a diagnostic benchmark designed to disentangle instruction compliance from physical reasoning competence in electrical circuit analysis. CircuChain consists of counterbalanced Control/Trap problem pairs across five canonical circuit topologies, augmented with systematic variations in sign conventions, current orientations, and polarity definitions. A multi-stage verification pipeline, combining symbolic solvers, SPICE simulation, and an LLM-based error taxonomy, enables fine-grained attribution of failures to convention errors, physics errors, arithmetic mistakes, or hallucinations. Across 100 tasks per model, we observe a consistent Compliance-Competence Divergence. The strongest model evaluated exhibits near-perfect physical reasoning but a high rate of convention violations when Trap conditions deliberately invert natural sign patterns. Conversely, weaker models display lower physical fidelity yet superior adherence to explicit instructions. These results suggest that increased model capability does not guarantee improved constraint alignment and highlight the need for new evaluation frameworks that stress instruction-following under mathematically rigid domains. CircuChain provides one such framework and offers actionable insights for both engineering education and AI alignment research.

## 52. EduResearchBench: A Hierarchical Atomic Task Decomposition Benchmark for Full-Lifecycle Educational Research
- **Authors**: Houping Yue , Zixiang Di , Mei Jiang , Bingdong Li , Hao Hao , Yu Song , Bo Jiang , Aimin Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15034)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the paradigm of AI for Social Science (AI4SS), rigorously evaluating their capabilities in scholarly writing remains a major challenge. Existing benchmarks largely emphasize single-shot, monolithic generation and thus lack the fine-grained assessments required to reflect complex academic research workflows. To fill this gap, we introduce EduResearchBench, the first comprehensive evaluation platform dedicated to educational academic writing. EduResearchBench is built upon our Hierarchical Atomic Task Decomposition (HATD) framework, which decomposes an end-to-end research workflow into six specialized research modules (e.g., Quantitative Analysis, Qualitative Research, and Policy Research) spanning 24 fine-grained atomic tasks. This taxonomy enables an automated evaluation pipeline that mitigates a key limitation of holistic scoring, where aggregate scores often obscure specific capability bottlenecks, and instead provides fine-grained, diagnostic feedback on concrete deficiencies. Moreover, recognizing the high cognitive load inherent in scholarly writing, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that progressively builds competence from foundational skills to complex methodological reasoning and argumentation. Leveraging 55K raw academic samples, we curate 11K high-quality instruction pairs to train EduWrite, a specialized educational scholarly writing model. Experiments show that EduWrite (30B) substantially outperforms larger general-purpose models (72B) on multiple core metrics, demonstrating that in vertical domains, data quality density and hierarchically staged training curricula are more decisive than parameter scale.

## 53. LemonadeBench: Evaluating the Economic Intuition of Large Language Models in Simple Markets
- **Authors**: Aidan Vyas
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13209)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce LemonadeBench v0.5, a minimal benchmark for evaluating economic intuition, long-term planning, and decision-making under uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) through a simulated lemonade stand business. Models must manage inventory with expiring goods, set prices, choose operating hours, and maximize profit over a 30-day period-tasks that any small business owner faces daily. All models demonstrate meaningful economic agency by achieving profitability, with performance scaling dramatically by sophistication-from basic models earning minimal profits to frontier models capturing 70% of theoretical optimal, a greater than 10x improvement. Yet our decomposition of business efficiency across six dimensions reveals a consistent pattern: models achieve local rather than global optimization, excelling in select areas while exhibiting surprising blind spots elsewhere.
