- **Abstract**:
> Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) enable test-time scaling, with dataset-level accuracy improving as the token budget increases, motivating adaptive reasoning -- spending tokens when they improve reliability and stopping early when additional computation is unlikely to help. However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism. Empirical results across diverse reasoning tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk control approach, demonstrating computational efficiency gains from the lower threshold and ensemble stopping mechanisms while adhering to the user-specified risk target.

## 2. Understanding Agent Scaling in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems via Diversity
- **Authors**: Yingxuan Yang , Chengrui Qu , Muning Wen , Laixi Shi , Ying Wen , Weinan Zhang , Adam Wierman , Shangding Gu

- **Abstract**:
> LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex tasks that are difficult for individual LLMs. A natural strategy is to scale performance by increasing the number of agents; however, we find that such scaling exhibits strong diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, while introducing heterogeneity (e.g., different models, prompts, or tools) continues to yield substantial gains. This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design. Code and Dataset are available at the link: this https URL .

- **Authors**: Wenzhe Fan , Tommaso Tognoli , Henry Peng Zou , Chunyu Miao , Yibo Wang , Xinhua Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03688](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03688)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-round LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on effective communication structures to support collaboration across rounds. However, most existing methods employ a fixed communication topology during inference, which falls short in many realistic applications where the agents' roles may change \textit{across rounds} due to dynamic adversary, task progression, or time-varying constraints such as communication bandwidth. In this paper, we propose addressing this issue through TodyComm, a \textbf{t}ask-\textbf{o}riented \textbf{dy}namic \textbf{comm}unication algorithm. It produces behavior-driven collaboration topologies that adapt to the dynamics at each round, optimizing the utility for the task through policy gradient. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that under both dynamic adversary and communications budgets, TodyComm delivers superior task effectiveness while retaining token efficiency and scalability.

## 4. Mitigating Conversational Inertia in Multi-Turn Agents
- **Authors**: Yang Wan , Zheng Cao , Zhenhao Zhang , Zhengwen Zeng , Shuheng Shen , Changhua Meng , Linchao Zhu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03664](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03664)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models excel as few-shot learners when provided with appropriate demonstrations, yet this strength becomes problematic in multiturn agent scenarios, where LLMs erroneously mimic their own previous responses as few-shot examples. Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements.

## 5. Can LLMs Do Rocket Science? Exploring the Limits of Complex Reasoning with GTOC 12
- **Authors**: Iñaki del Campo , Pablo Cuervo , Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez , Roberto Armellin , Jack Yarndley
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03630](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03630)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers.

## 6. EHRWorld: A Patient-Centric Medical World Model for Long-Horizon Clinical Trajectories
- **Authors**: Linjie Mu , Zhongzhen Huang , Yannian Gu , Shengqian Qin , Shaoting Zhang , Xiaofan Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03569](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03569)
- **Abstract**:
> World models offer a principled framework for simulating future states under interventions, but realizing such models in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine remains challenging. Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03545)
- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating AI systems that interact with humans requires understanding their behavior across diverse user populations, but collecting representative human data is often expensive or infeasible, particularly for novel technologies or hypothetical future scenarios. Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes. We demonstrate that evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts, producing populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs.

## 8. When Routing Collapses: On the Degenerate Convergence of LLM Routers
- **Authors**: Guannan Lai , Han-Jia Ye
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03478](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03478)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM routing aims to achieve a favorable quality--cost trade-off by dynamically assigning easy queries to smaller models and harder queries to stronger ones. However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. Our code is available at this https URL .

## 9. IntentRL: Training Proactive User-intent Agents for Open-ended Deep Research via Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Haohao Luo , Zexi Li , Yuexiang Xie , Wenhao Zhang , Yaliang Li , Ying Shen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03468](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03468)
- **Abstract**:
> Deep Research (DR) agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge by autonomously retrieving and synthesizing evidence from large web corpora into long-form reports, enabling a long-horizon agentic paradigm. However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes. To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines.

- **Authors**: Xiaochi Zhou , Patrick Bulter , Changxuan Yang , Simon D. Rihm , Thitikarn Angkanaporn , Jethro Akroyd , Sebastian Mosbach , Markus Kraft
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03439)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce ontology-to-tools compilation as a proof-of-principle mechanism for coupling large language models (LLMs) with formal domain knowledge. Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.

## 11. DiscoverLLM: From Executing Intents to Discovering Them
- **Authors**: Tae Soo Kim , Yoonjoo Lee , Jaesang Yu , John Joon Young Chung , Juho Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03429](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03429)
- **Abstract**:
> To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.

## 12. Risk Awareness Injection: Calibrating Vision-Language Models for Safety without Compromising Utility
- **Authors**: Mengxuan Wang , Yuxin Chen , Gang Xu , Tao He , Hongjie Jiang , Ming Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03402](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03402)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.

## 13. GFlowPO: Generative Flow Network as a Language Model Prompt Optimizer
- **Authors**: Junmo Cho , Suhan Kim , Sangjune An , Minsu Kim , Dong Bok Lee , Heejun Lee , Sung Ju Hwang , Hae Beom Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03358)
- **Abstract**:
> Finding effective prompts for language models (LMs) is critical yet notoriously difficult: the prompt space is combinatorially large, rewards are sparse due to expensive target-LM evaluation. Yet, existing RL-based prompt optimizers often rely on on-policy updates and a meta-prompt sampled from a fixed distribution, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose GFlowPO, a probabilistic prompt optimization framework that casts prompt search as a posterior inference problem over latent prompts regularized by a meta-prompted reference-LM prior. In the first step, we fine-tune a lightweight prompt-LM with an off-policy Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objective, using a replay-based training policy that reuses past prompt evaluations to enable sample-efficient exploration. In the second step, we introduce Dynamic Memory Update (DMU), a training-free mechanism that updates the meta-prompt by injecting both (i) diverse prompts from a replay buffer and (ii) top-performing prompts from a small priority queue, thereby progressively concentrating the search process on high-reward regions. Across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks, GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines.

## 14. MentalSeek-Dx: Towards Progressive Hypothetico-Deductive Reasoning for Real-world Psychiatric Diagnosis
- **Authors**: Xiao Sun , Yuming Yang , Junnan Zhu , Jiang Zhong , Xinyu Zhou , Kaiwen Wei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03340](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03340)
- **Abstract**:
> Mental health disorders represent a burgeoning global public health challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in psychiatric assessment, their clinical utility is severely constrained by benchmarks that lack ecological validity and fine-grained diagnostic supervision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MentalDx Bench}, the first benchmark dedicated to disorder-level psychiatric diagnosis within real-world clinical settings. Comprising 712 de-identified electronic health records annotated by board-certified psychiatrists under ICD-11 guidelines, the benchmark covers 76 disorders across 16 diagnostic categories. Evaluation of 18 LLMs reveals a critical \textit{paradigm misalignment}: strong performance at coarse diagnostic categorization contrasts with systematic failure at disorder-level diagnosis, underscoring a gap between pattern-based modeling and clinical hypothetico-deductive reasoning. In response, we propose \textbf{MentalSeek-Dx}, a medical-specialized LLM trained to internalize this clinical reasoning process through supervised trajectory construction and curriculum-based reinforcement learning. Experiments on MentalDx Bench demonstrate that MentalSeek-Dx achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with only 14B parameters, establishing a clinically grounded framework for reliable psychiatric diagnosis.

## 15. Agentic Proposing: Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning via Compositional Skill Synthesis
- **Authors**: Zhengbo Jiao , Shaobo Wang , Zifan Zhang , Xuan Ren , Wei Wang , Bing Zhao , Hu Wei , Linfeng Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03279](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03279)
- **Abstract**:
> Advancing complex reasoning in large language models relies on high-quality, verifiable datasets, yet human annotation remains cost-prohibitive and difficult to scale. Current synthesis paradigms often face a recurring trade-off: maintaining structural validity typically restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty frequently leads to inconsistent or unsolvable instances. To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets.

## 16. CSR-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Cross-modal Safety and Reliability of MLLMs
- **Authors**: Yuxuan Liu , Yuntian Shi , Kun Wang , Haoting Shen , Kun Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03263](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03263)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable interaction over both text and images, but their safety behavior can be driven by unimodal shortcuts instead of true joint intent understanding. We introduce CSR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reliability through four stress-testing interaction patterns spanning Safety, Over-rejection, Bias, and Hallucination, covering 61 fine-grained types. Each instance is constructed to require integrated image-text interpretation, and we additionally provide paired text-only controls to diagnose modality-induced behavior shifts. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe systematic cross-modal alignment gaps. Models show weak safety awareness, strong language dominance under interference, and consistent performance degradation from text-only controls to multimodal inputs. We also observe a clear trade-off between reducing over-rejection and maintaining safe, non-discriminatory behavior, suggesting that some apparent safety gains may come from refusal-oriented heuristics rather than robust intent understanding. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe contents.

## 17. LPS-Bench: Benchmarking Safety Awareness of Computer-Use Agents in Long-Horizon Planning under Benign and Adversarial Scenarios
- **Authors**: Tianyu Chen , Chujia Hu , Ge Gao , Dongrui Liu , Xia Hu , Wenjie Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03255](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03255)
- **Abstract**:
> Computer-use agents (CUAs) that interact with real computer systems can perform automated tasks but face critical safety risks. Ambiguous instructions may trigger harmful actions, and adversarial users can manipulate tool execution to achieve malicious goals. Existing benchmarks mostly focus on short-horizon or GUI-based tasks, evaluating on execution-time errors but overlooking the ability to anticipate planning-time risks. To fill this gap, we present LPS-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates the planning-time safety awareness of MCP-based CUAs under long-horizon tasks, covering both benign and adversarial interactions across 65 scenarios of 7 task domains and 9 risk types. We introduce a multi-agent automated pipeline for scalable data generation and adopt an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess safety awareness through the planning trajectory. Experiments reveal substantial deficiencies in existing CUAs' ability to maintain safe behavior. We further analyze the risks and propose mitigation strategies to improve long-horizon planning safety in MCP-based CUA systems. We open-source our code at this https URL .

## 18. Accordion-Thinking: Self-Regulated Step Summaries for Efficient and Readable LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Zhicheng Yang , Zhijiang Guo , Yinya Huang , Yongxin Wang , Wenlei Shi , Yiwei Wang , Xiaodan Liang , Jing Tang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03249](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03249)
- **Abstract**:
> Scaling test-time compute via long Chain-ofThought unlocks remarkable gains in reasoning capabilities, yet it faces practical limits due to the linear growth of KV cache and quadratic attention complexity. In this paper, we introduce Accordion-Thinking, an end-to-end framework where LLMs learn to self-regulate the granularity of the reasoning steps through dynamic summarization. This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process.

## 19. The Necessity of a Unified Framework for LLM-Based Agent Evaluation
- **Authors**: Pengyu Zhu , Li Sun , Philip S. Yu , Sen Su
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03238](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03238)
- **Abstract**:
> With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation.

## 20. Beyond Quantity: Trajectory Diversity Scaling for Code Agents
- **Authors**: Guhong Chen , Chenghao Sun , Cheng Fu , Qiyao Wang , Zhihong Huang , Chaopeng Wei , Guangxu Chen , Feiteng Fang , Ahmadreza Argha , Bing Zhao , Xander Xu , Qi Han , Hamid Alinejad-Rokny , Qiang Qu , Binhua Li , Shiwen Ni , Min Yang , Hu Wei , Yongbin Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03219](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03219)
- **Abstract**:
> As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.

## 21. VALUEFLOW: Toward Pluralistic and Steerable Value-based Alignment in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Woojin Kim , Sieun Hyeon , Jusang Oh , Jaeyoung Do
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03160](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03160)
- **Abstract**:
> Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with the diverse spectrum of human values remains a central challenge: preference-based methods often fail to capture deeper motivational principles. Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs.

## 22. Enhancing Foundation VLM Robustness to Missing Modality: Scalable Diffusion for Bi-directional Feature Restoration
- **Authors**: Wei Dai , Haoyu Wang , Honghao Chang , Lijun He , Fan Li , Jian Sun , Haixia Bi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03151](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03151)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically assume complete modality input during inference. However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm our model as a robust and scalable extension for VLMs in missing modality scenarios, ensuring reliability across diverse missing rates and environments. Our code and models will be publicly available.

## 23. Understanding Multi-Agent LLM Frameworks: A Unified Benchmark and Experimental Analysis
- **Authors**: Abdelghny Orogat , Ana Rostam , Essam Mansour
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03128](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03128)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-agent LLM frameworks are widely used to accelerate the development of agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs). These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%. Finally, we translate our findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outline promising future research directions.

- **Authors**: Jingnan Zheng , Yanzhen Luo , Jingjun Xu , Bingnan Liu , Yuxin Chen , Chenhang Cui , Gelei Deng , Chaochao Lu , Xiang Wang , An Zhang , Tat-Seng Chua
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03100](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03100)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that operate in real-world environments, introducing safety risks beyond linguistic harm. Existing agent safety evaluations rely on risk-oriented tasks tailored to specific agent settings, resulting in limited coverage of safety risk space and failing to assess agent safety behavior during long-horizon, interactive task execution in complex real-world deployments. Moreover, their specialization to particular agent settings limits adaptability across diverse agent configurations. To address these limitations, we propose Risky-Bench, a framework that enables systematic agent safety evaluation grounded in real-world deployment. Risky-Bench organizes evaluation around domain-agnostic safety principles to derive context-aware safety rubrics that delineate safety space, and systematically evaluates safety risks across this space through realistic task execution under varying threat assumptions. When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions. Moreover, as a well-structured evaluation pipeline, Risky-Bench is not confined to life-assist scenarios and can be adapted to other deployment settings to construct environment-specific safety evaluations, providing an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment.

## 25. De-conflating Preference and Qualification: Constrained Dual-Perspective Reasoning for Job Recommendation with Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Bryce Kan , Wei Yang , Emily Nguyen , Ganghui Yi , Bowen Yi , Chenxiao Yu , Yan Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03097](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03097)
- **Abstract**:
> Professional job recommendation involves a complex bipartite matching process that must reconcile a candidate's subjective preference with an employer's objective qualification. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-suited for modeling the rich semantics of resumes and job descriptions, existing paradigms often collapse these two decision dimensions into a single interaction signal, yielding confounded supervision under recruitment-funnel censoring and limiting policy controllability. To address these challenges, We propose JobRec, a generative job recommendation framework for de-conflating preference and qualification via constrained dual-perspective reasoning. JobRec introduces a Unified Semantic Alignment Schema that aligns candidate and job attributes into structured semantic layers, and a Two-Stage Cooperative Training Strategy that learns decoupled experts to separately infer preference and qualification. Building on these experts, a Lagrangian-based Policy Alignment module optimizes recommendations under explicit eligibility requirements, enabling controllable trade-offs. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a synthetic dataset refined by experts. Experiments show that JobRec consistently outperforms strong baselines and provides improved controllability for strategy-aware professional matching.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03053](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03053)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit high variance in their reasoning trajectories. Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

## 27. Visual Reasoning over Time Series via Multi-Agent System
- **Authors**: Weilin Ruan , Yuxuan Liang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03026)
- **Abstract**:
> Time series analysis underpins many real-world applications, yet existing time-series-specific methods and pretrained large-model-based approaches remain limited in integrating intuitive visual reasoning and generalizing across tasks with adaptive tool usage. To address these limitations, we propose MAS4TS, a tool-driven multi-agent system for general time series tasks, built upon an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm that integrates agent communication, visual reasoning, and latent reconstruction within a unified framework. MAS4TS first performs visual reasoning over time series plots with structured priors using a Vision-Language Model to extract temporal structures, and subsequently reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, while a router selects task-specific tool chains for execution. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series tasks, while exhibiting strong generalization and efficient inference.

## 28. RC-GRPO: Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization for Multi-Turn Tool Calling Agents
- **Authors**: Haitian Zhong , Jixiu Zhai , Lei Song , Jiang Bian , Qiang Liu , Tieniu Tan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03025)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-turn tool calling is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) because rewards are sparse and exploration is expensive. A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v4 (BFCLv4) multi-turn benchmark, our method yields consistently improved performance than baselines, and the performance on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct even surpasses all closed-source API models.

## 29. STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement for Super-Tiny Function Calling Models
- **Authors**: Jiliang Ni , Jiachen Pu , Zhongyi Yang , Jingfeng Luo , Conggang Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03022)
- **Abstract**:
> The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in function calling is pivotal for creating advanced AI agents, yet their large scale hinders widespread adoption, necessitating transferring their capabilities into smaller ones. However, existing paradigms are often plagued by overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and the difficulty of synergizing techniques. We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. Remarkably, our 0.6B STAR model achieves the best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing even several well-known open models at a larger scale. STAR demonstrates a training framework that distills capabilities of LLMs into super-tiny models, paving the way for powerful, accessible, and efficient AI agents.

## 30. Distilling LLM Reasoning into Graph of Concept Predictors
- **Authors**: Ziyang Yu , Liang Zhao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03006](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03006)
- **Abstract**:
> Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for discriminative workloads is often limited by inference latency, compute, and API costs at scale. Active distillation reduces these costs by querying an LLM oracle to train compact discriminative students, but most pipelines distill only final labels, discarding intermediate reasoning signals and offering limited diagnostics of what reasoning is missing and where errors arise. We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules. Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks demonstrate that GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

## 31. Methods and Open Problems in Differentiable Social Choice: Learning Mechanisms, Decisions, and Alignment
- **Authors**: Zhiyu An , Wan Du
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03003](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03003)
- **Abstract**:
> Social choice is no longer a peripheral concern of political theory or economics-it has become a foundational component of modern machine learning systems. From auctions and resource allocation to federated learning, participatory governance, and the alignment of large language models, machine learning pipelines increasingly aggregate heterogeneous preferences, incentives, and judgments into collective decisions. In effect, many contemporary machine learning systems already implement social choice mechanisms, often implicitly and without explicit normative scrutiny. This Review surveys differentiable social choice: an emerging paradigm that formulates voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as learnable, differentiable models optimized from data. We synthesize work across auctions, voting, budgeting, liquid democracy, decentralized aggregation, and inverse mechanism learning, showing how classical axioms and impossibility results reappear as objectives, constraints, and optimization trade-offs. We conclude by identifying 36 open problems defining a new research agenda at the intersection of machine learning, economics, and democratic theory.

## 32. Large Language Models Can Take False First Steps at Inference-time Planning
- **Authors**: Haijiang Yan , Jian-Qiao Zhu , Adam Sanborn
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02991](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02991)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to acquire sequence-level planning abilities during training, yet their planning behavior exhibited at inference time often appears short-sighted and inconsistent with these capabilities. We propose a Bayesian account for this gap by grounding planning behavior in the evolving generative context: given the subtle differences between natural language and the language internalized by LLMs, accumulated self-generated context drives a planning-shift during inference and thereby creates the appearance of compromised planning behavior. We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences. These findings provide a theoretical explanation along with empirical evidence for characterizing how LLMs plan ahead during inference.

## 33. Are LLMs Biased Like Humans? Causal Reasoning as a Function of Prior Knowledge, Irrelevant Information, and Reasoning Budget
- **Authors**: Hanna M. Dettki , Charley M. Wu , Bob Rehder
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02983](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02983)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in domains where causal reasoning matters, yet it remains unclear whether their judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching. We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \!\rightarrow\! E\! \leftarrow \!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.

## 34. Generative Engine Optimization: A VLM and Agent Framework for Pinterest Acquisition Growth
- **Authors**: Faye Zhang , Qianyu Cheng , Jasmine Wan , Vishwakarma Singh , Jinfeng Rao , Kofi Boakye
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02961](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02961)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models are fundamentally reshaping content discovery through AI-native search systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Unlike traditional search engines that match keywords to documents, these systems infer user intent, synthesize multimodal evidence, and generate contextual answers directly on the search page, introducing a paradigm shift from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). For visual content platforms hosting billions of assets, this poses an acute challenge: individual images lack the semantic depth and authority signals that generative search prioritizes, risking disintermediation as user needs are satisfied in-place without site visits. We present Pinterest GEO, a production-scale framework that pioneers reverse search design: rather than generating generic image captions describing what content is, we fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict what users would actually search for, augmented this with AI agents that mine real-time internet trends to capture emerging search demand. These VLM-generated queries then drive construction of semantically coherent Collection Pages via multimodal embeddings, creating indexable aggregations optimized for generative retrieval. Finally, we employ hybrid VLM and two-tower ANN architectures to build authority-aware interlinking structures that propagate signals across billions of visual assets. Deployed at scale across billions of images and tens of millions of collections, GEO delivers 20\% organic traffic growth contributing to multi-million monthly active user (MAU) growth, demonstrating a principled pathway for visual platforms to thrive in the generative search era.

## 35. DeltaEvolve: Accelerating Scientific Discovery through Momentum-Driven Evolution
- **Authors**: Jiachen Jiang , Tianyu Ding , Zhihui Zhu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02919](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02919)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM-driven evolutionary systems have shown promise for automated science discovery, yet existing approaches such as AlphaEvolve rely on full-code histories that are context-inefficient and potentially provide weak evolutionary guidance. In this work, we first formalize the evolutionary agents as a general Expectation-Maximization framework, where the language model samples candidate programs (E-step) and the system updates the control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced. Empirical evaluations on tasks across diverse scientific domains show that our framework can discover better solution with less token consumption over full-code-based evolutionary agents.

## 36. Reasoning about Reasoning: BAPO Bounds on Chain-of-Thought Token Complexity in LLMs
- **Authors**: Kiran Tomlinson , Tobias Schnabel , Adith Swaminathan , Jennifer Neville
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02909](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02909)
- **Abstract**:
> Inference-time scaling via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a major driver of state-of-the-art LLM performance, but it comes with substantial latency and compute costs. We address a fundamental theoretical question: how many reasoning tokens are required to solve a problem as input size grows? By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $\Omega(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions. Finally, our experiments with frontier reasoning models show approximately linear reasoning token scaling on these tasks and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets, consistent with our theoretical lower bounds. Together, our results identify fundamental bottlenecks in inference-time compute through CoT and offer a principled tool for analyzing optimal reasoning length.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02905](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02905)
- **Abstract**:
> Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate scientific discovery end-to-end, but rigorously evaluating their capacity for verifiable discovery remains a central challenge. Existing benchmarks face a trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-as-judge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning. FIRE-Bench provides a rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery.

## 38. Aligning Language Model Benchmarks with Pairwise Preferences
- **Authors**: Marco Gutierrez , Xinyi Leng , Hannah Cyberey , Jonathan Richard Schwarz , Ahmed Alaa , Thomas Hartvigsen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02898](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02898)
- **Abstract**:
> Language model benchmarks are pervasive and computationally-efficient proxies for real-world performance. However, many recent works find that benchmarks often fail to predict real utility. Towards bridging this gap, we introduce benchmark alignment, where we use limited amounts of information about model performance to automatically update offline benchmarks, aiming to produce new static benchmarks that predict model pairwise preferences in given test settings. We then propose BenchAlign, the first solution to this problem, which learns preference-aligned weight- ings for benchmark questions using the question-level performance of language models alongside ranked pairs of models that could be collected during deployment, producing new benchmarks that rank previously unseen models according to these preferences. Our experiments show that our aligned benchmarks can accurately rank unseen models according to models of human preferences, even across different sizes, while remaining interpretable. Overall, our work provides insights into the limits of aligning benchmarks with practical human preferences, which stands to accelerate model development towards real utility.

## 39. "I May Not Have Articulated Myself Clearly": Diagnosing Dynamic Instability in LLM Reasoning at Inference Time
- **Authors**: Jinkun Chen , Fengxiang Cheng , Sijia Han , Vlado Keselj
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02863](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02863)
- **Abstract**:
> Reasoning failures in large language models (LLMs) are typically measured only at the end of a generation, yet many failures manifest as a process-level breakdown: the model "loses the thread" mid-reasoning. We study whether such breakdowns are detectable from inference-time observables available in standard APIs (token log probabilities), without any training or fine-tuning. We define a simple instability signal that combines consecutive-step distributional shift (JSD) and uncertainty (entropy), summarize each trace by its peak instability strength, and show that this signal reliably predicts failure. Across GSM8K and HotpotQA, instability strength predicts wrong answers with above-chance AUC and yields monotonic bucket-level accuracy decline at scale across model sizes. Crucially, we show that instability is not uniformly harmful: early instability can reflect subsequent stabilization and a correct final answer (\emph{corrective instability}), whereas late instability is more often followed by failure (\emph{destructive instability}), even at comparable peak magnitudes, indicating that recoverability depends not only on how strongly the distribution changes but also on when such changes occur relative to the remaining decoding horizon. The method is model-agnostic, training-free, and reproducible, and is presented as a diagnostic lens rather than a corrective or control mechanism.

## 40. STEER: Inference-Time Risk Control via Constrained Quality-Diversity Search
- **Authors**: Eric Yang , Jong Ha Lee , Jonathan Amar , Elissa Ye , Yugang Jia
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02862](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02862)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for average correctness often exhibit mode collapse, producing narrow decision behaviors on tasks where multiple responses may be reasonable. This limitation is particularly problematic in ordinal decision settings such as clinical triage, where standard alignment removes the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity (the ROC operating point) based on contextual constraints. We propose STEER (Steerable Tuning via Evolutionary Ensemble Refinement), a training-free framework that reintroduces this tunable control. STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, STEER exposes a single, interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding a monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness. On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to a representative post-training method, STEER maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions. These results demonstrate STEER as a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control, capable of steering behavior without compromising domain competence.

## 41. AutoSizer: Automatic Sizing of Analog and Mixed-Signal Circuits via Large Language Model (LLM) Agents
- **Authors**: Xi Yu , Dmitrii Torbunov , Soumyajit Mandal , Yihui Ren
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02849](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02849)
- **Abstract**:
> The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits remains heavily reliant on expert knowledge, with transistor sizing a major bottleneck due to nonlinear behavior, high-dimensional design spaces, and strict performance constraints. Existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methods typically frame sizing as static black-box optimization, resulting in inefficient and less robust solutions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints. AutoSizer experimentally achieves higher solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rate across varying circuit difficulties, outperforming both traditional optimization methods and existing LLM-based agents.

## 42. Chain of Simulation: A Dual-Mode Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models with Dynamic Problem Routing
- **Authors**: Saeid Sheikhi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02842](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02842)
- **Abstract**:
> We present Chain of Simulation (CoS), a novel dual-mode reasoning framework that dynamically routes problems to specialized reasoning strategies in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing uniform prompting approaches, CoS employs three distinct reasoning modes: (1) computational flow with self-consistency for mathematical problems, (2) symbolic state tracking with JSON representations for spatial reasoning, and (3) hybrid fact-extraction for multi-hop inference. Through comprehensive evaluation on GSM8K, StrategyQA, and bAbI benchmarks using four state-of-the-art models (Gemma-3 27B, LLaMA-3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Qwen-2.5 14B), we demonstrate that CoS achieves 71.5% accuracy on GSM8K (1.0% absolute improvement), 90.0% on StrategyQA (2.5% improvement), and 19.0% on bAbI (65.2% relative improvement) compared to the strongest baselines. The analysis reveals that problem-specific mode selection is crucial, with computational mode achieving 81.2% accuracy when correctly applied to mathematical problems, while misrouting leads to 0% accuracy. We provide detailed algorithms for mode selection, state tracking, and answer extraction, establishing CoS as an effective approach for improving LLM reasoning without additional training. The framework provides superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency compared to Self-Consistency, achieving comparable performance at 54% lower computational cost.

## 43. Scaling-Aware Adapter for Structure-Grounded LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Zihao Jing , Qiuhao Zeng , Ruiyi Fang , Yan Yi Li , Yan Sun , Boyu Wang , Pingzhao Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02780)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are enabling reasoning over biomolecular structures, yet existing methods remain modality-specific and typically compress structural inputs through sequence-based tokenization or fixed-length query connectors. Such architectures either omit the geometric groundings requisite for mitigating structural hallucinations or impose inflexible modality fusion bottlenecks that concurrently over-compress and suboptimally allocate structural tokens, thereby impeding the realization of generalized all-atom reasoning. We introduce Cuttlefish, a unified all-atom LLM that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while scaling modality tokens with structural complexity. First, Scaling-Aware Patching leverages an instruction-conditioned gating mechanism to generate variable-size patches over structural graphs, adaptively scaling the query token budget with structural complexity to mitigate fixed-length connector bottlenecks. Second, Geometry Grounding Adapter refines these adaptive tokens via cross-attention to modality embeddings and injects the resulting modality tokens into the LLM, exposing explicit geometric cues to reduce structural hallucination. Experiments across diverse all-atom benchmarks demonstrate that Cuttlefish achieves superior performance in heterogeneous structure-grounded reasoning. Code is available at the project repository.

## 44. Dynamic Mix Precision Routing for Efficient Multi-step LLM Interaction
- **Authors**: Yuanzhe Li , Jianing Deng , Jingtong Hu , Tianlong Chen , Song Wang , Huanrui Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02711](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02711)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLM) achieve strong performance in long-horizon decision-making tasks through multi-step interaction and reasoning at test time. While practitioners commonly believe a higher task success rate necessitates the use of a larger and stronger LLM model, multi-step interaction with a large LLM incurs prohibitive inference cost. To address this problem, we explore the use of low-precision quantized LLM in the long-horizon decision-making process. Based on the observation of diverse sensitivities among interaction steps, we propose a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step. The router is trained via a two-stage pipeline, consisting of KL-divergence-based supervised learning that identifies precision-sensitive steps, followed by Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further improve task success rates. Experiments on ALFWorld demonstrate that our approach achieves a great improvement on accuracy-cost trade-off over single-precision baselines and heuristic routing methods.

## 45. ATLAS : Adaptive Self-Evolutionary Research Agent with Task-Distributed Multi-LLM Supporters
- **Authors**: Ujin Jeon , Jiyong Kwon , Madison Ann Sullivan , Caleb Eunho Lee , Guang Lin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02709)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent multi-LLM agent systems perform well in prompt optimization and automated problem-solving, but many either keep the solver frozen after fine-tuning or rely on a static preference-optimization loop, which becomes intractable for long-horizon tasks. We propose ATLAS (Adaptive Task-distributed Learning for Agentic Self-evolution), a task-distributed framework that iteratively develops a lightweight research agent while delegating complementary roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Our core algorithm, Evolving Direct Preference Optimization (EvoDPO), adaptively updates the phase-indexed reference policy. We provide a theoretical regret analysis for a preference-based contextual bandit under concept drift. In addition, experiments were conducted on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and scientific machine learning (SciML) loss reweighting for the 1D Burgers' equation. Both results show that ATLAS improves stability and performance over a static single-agent baseline.

## 46. MARS: Modular Agent with Reflective Search for Automated AI Research
- **Authors**: Jiefeng Chen , Bhavana Dalvi Mishra , Jaehyun Nam , Rui Meng , Tomas Pfister , Jinsung Yoon
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02660](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02660)
- **Abstract**:
> Automating AI research differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a "Design-Decompose-Implement" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative "Aha!" moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths.

## 47. A Positive Case for Faithfulness: LLM Self-Explanations Help Predict Model Behavior
- **Authors**: Harry Mayne , Justin Singh Kang , Dewi Gould , Kannan Ramchandran , Adam Mahdi , Noah Y. Siegel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02639](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02639)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM self-explanations are often presented as a promising tool for AI oversight, yet their faithfulness to the model's true reasoning process is poorly understood. Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior.

## 48. PeerRank: Autonomous LLM Evaluation Through Web-Grounded, Bias-Controlled Peer Review
- **Authors**: Yanki Margalit , Erni Avram , Ran Taig , Oded Margalit , Nurit Cohen-Inger
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02589](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02589)
- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating large language models typically relies on human-authored benchmarks, reference answers, and human or single-model judgments, approaches that scale poorly, become quickly outdated, and mismatch open-world deployments that depend on web retrieval and synthesis. We introduce PeerRank, a fully autonomous end-to-end evaluation framework in which models generate evaluation tasks, answer them with category-scoped live web grounding, judge peer responses and aggregate dense peer assessments into relative performance estimates, without human supervision or gold references. PeerRank treats evaluation as a multi-agent process where each model participates symmetrically as task designer, respondent, and evaluator, while removing biased judgments. In a large-scale study over 12 commercially available models and 420 autonomously generated questions, PeerRank produces stable, discriminative rankings and reveals measurable identity and presentation biases. Rankings are robust, and mean peer scores agree with Elo. We further validate PeerRank on TruthfulQA and GSM8K, where peer scores correlate with objective accuracy. Together, these results suggest that bias-aware peer evaluation with selective web-grounded answering can scale open-world LLM assessment beyond static and human curated benchmarks.

## 49. Uncertainty and Fairness Awareness in LLM-Based Recommendation Systems
- **Authors**: Chandan Kumar Sah , Xiaoli Lian , Li Zhang , Tony Xu , Syed Shazaib Shah
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02582)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) enable powerful zero-shot recommendations by leveraging broad contextual knowledge, yet predictive uncertainty and embedded biases threaten reliability and fairness. This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations. We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs and motivate future work on multi-model benchmarks and adaptive calibration for trustworthy deployment.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02559](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02559)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances have enabled large language model (LLM) agents to solve complex tasks by orchestrating external tools. However, these agents often struggle in specialized, tool-intensive domains that demand long-horizon execution, tight coordination across modalities, and strict adherence to implicit tool constraints. Earth Observation (EO) tasks exemplify this challenge due to the multi-modal and multi-temporal data inputs, as well as the requirements of geo-knowledge constraints (spectrum library, spatial reasoning, etc): many high-level plans can be derailed by subtle execution errors that propagate through a pipeline and invalidate final results. A core difficulty is that existing agents lack a mechanism to learn fine-grained, tool-level expertise from interaction. Without such expertise, they cannot reliably configure tool parameters or recover from mid-execution failures, limiting their effectiveness in complex EO workflows. To address this, we introduce \textbf{GeoEvolver}, a self-evolving multi-agent system~(MAS) that enables LLM agents to acquire EO expertise through structured interaction without any parameter updates. GeoEvolver decomposes each query into independent sub-goals via a retrieval-augmented multi-agent orchestrator, then explores diverse tool-parameter configurations at the sub-goal level. Successful patterns and root-cause attribution from failures are then distilled in an evolving memory bank that provides in-context demonstrations for future queries. Experiments on three tool-integrated EO benchmarks show that GeoEvolver consistently improves end-to-end task success, with an average gain of 12\% across multiple LLM backbones, demonstrating that EO expertise can emerge progressively from efficient, fine-grained interactions with the environment.

## 51. CreditAudit: 2D Auditing for LLM Evaluation and Selection
- **Authors**: Yiliang Song , Hongjun An , Jiangong Xiao , Haofei Zhao , Jiawei Shao , Xuelong Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02515](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02515)
- **Abstract**:
> Leaderboard scores on public benchmarks have been steadily rising and converging, with many frontier language models now separated by only marginal differences. However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.

- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for accelerating scientific research. While models are increasingly capable of assisting with routine tasks, their ability to contribute to novel, expert-level mathematical discovery is less understood. We present a collection of case studies demonstrating how researchers have successfully collaborated with advanced AI models, specifically Google's Gemini-based models (in particular Gemini Deep Think and its advanced variants), to solve open problems, refute conjectures, and generate new proofs across diverse areas in theoretical computer science, as well as other areas such as economics, optimization, and physics. Based on these experiences, we extract common techniques for effective human-AI collaboration in theoretical research, such as iterative refinement, problem decomposition, and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer. While the majority of our results stem from this interactive, conversational methodology, we also highlight specific instances that push beyond standard chat interfaces. These include deploying the model as a rigorous adversarial reviewer to detect subtle flaws in existing proofs, and embedding it within a "neuro-symbolic" loop that autonomously writes and executes code to verify complex derivations. Together, these examples highlight the potential of AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a versatile, genuine partner in the creative process of scientific discovery.

## 53. Antidistillation Fingerprinting

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03812](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03812)
- **Abstract**:
> Model distillation enables efficient emulation of frontier large language models (LLMs), creating a need for robust mechanisms to detect when a third-party student model has trained on a teacher model's outputs. However, existing fingerprinting techniques that could be used to detect such distillation rely on heuristic perturbations that impose a steep trade-off between generation quality and fingerprinting strength, often requiring significant degradation of utility to ensure the fingerprint is effectively internalized by the student. We introduce antidistillation fingerprinting (ADFP), a principled approach that aligns the fingerprinting objective with the student's learning dynamics. Building upon the gradient-based framework of antidistillation sampling, ADFP utilizes a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that directly maximize the expected detectability of the fingerprint in the student after fine-tuning, rather than relying on the incidental absorption of the un-targeted biases of a more naive watermark. Experiments on GSM8K and OASST1 benchmarks demonstrate that ADFP achieves a significant Pareto improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, yielding stronger detection confidence with minimal impact on utility, even when the student model's architecture is unknown.

## 54. Bridging Online and Offline RL: Contextual Bandit Learning for Multi-Turn Code Generation
- **Authors**: Ziru Chen , Dongdong Chen , Ruinan Jin , Yingbin Liang , Yujia Xie , Huan Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03806](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03806)
- **Abstract**:
> Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation. Our code and data are available at this https URL .

## 55. Efficient Estimation of Kernel Surrogate Models for Task Attribution
- **Authors**: Zhenshuo Zhang , Minxuan Duan , Hongyang R. Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03783](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03783)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks.

## 56. An Empirical Study of Collective Behaviors and Social Dynamics in Large Language Model Agents
- **Authors**: Farnoosh Hashemi , Michael W. Macy
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03775](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03775)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate our social, cultural, and political interactions. While they can simulate some aspects of human behavior and decision-making, it is still underexplored whether repeated interactions with other agents amplify their biases or lead to exclusionary behaviors. To this end, we study this http URL -an LLM-driven social media platform-analyzing 7M posts and interactions among 32K LLM agents over a year. We start with homophily and social influence among LLMs, learning that similar to humans', their social networks exhibit these fundamental phenomena. Next, we study the toxic language of LLMs, its linguistic features, and their interaction patterns, finding that LLMs show different structural patterns in toxic posting than humans. After studying the ideological leaning in LLMs posts, and the polarization in their community, we focus on how to prevent their potential harmful activities. We present a simple yet effective method, called Chain of Social Thought (CoST), that reminds LLM agents to avoid harmful posting.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03772)
- **Abstract**:
> The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly limited by data quality. Most methods handle data mixing and sample selection separately, which can break the structure in code corpora. We introduce \textbf{UniGeM}, a framework that unifies mixing and selection by treating data curation as a \textit{manifold approximation} problem without training proxy models or relying on external reference datasets. UniGeM operates hierarchically: \textbf{Macro-Exploration} learns mixing weights with stability-based clustering; \textbf{Micro-Mining} filters high-quality instances by their geometric distribution to ensure logical consistency. Validated by training 8B and 16B MoE models on 100B tokens, UniGeM achieves \textbf{2.0$\times$ data efficiency} over a random baseline and further improves overall performance compared to SOTA methods in reasoning-heavy evaluations and multilingual generalization.

## 58. Zero-shot large vision-language model prompting for automated bone identification in paleoradiology x-ray archives
- **Authors**: Owen Dong , Lily Gao , Manish Kota , Bennett A. Landmana , Jelena Bekvalac , Gaynor Western , Katherine D. Van Schaik
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03750](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03750)
- **Abstract**:
> Paleoradiology, the use of modern imaging technologies to study archaeological and anthropological remains, offers new windows on millennial scale patterns of human health. Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases. These results suggest that LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, allowing for efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows.

- **Authors**: Yu Tian , Linh Huynh , Katerina Christhilf , Shubham Chakraborty , Micah Watanabe , Tracy Arner , Danielle McNamara
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03704](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03704)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated multiple-choice question (MCQ) generation increasingly feasible; however, reliably producing items that satisfy controlled cognitive demands remains a challenge. To address this gap, we introduce ReQUESTA, a hybrid, multi-agent framework for generating cognitively diverse MCQs that systematically target text-based, inferential, and main idea comprehension. ReQUESTA decomposes MCQ authoring into specialized subtasks and coordinates LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to support planning, controlled generation, iterative evaluation, and post-processing. We evaluated the framework in a large-scale reading comprehension study using academic expository texts, comparing ReQUESTA-generated MCQs with those produced by a single-pass GPT-5 zero-shot baseline. Psychometric analyses of learner responses assessed item difficulty and discrimination, while expert raters evaluated question quality across multiple dimensions, including topic relevance and distractor quality. Results showed that ReQUESTA-generated items were consistently more challenging, more discriminative, and more strongly aligned with overall reading comprehension performance. Expert evaluations further indicated stronger alignment with central concepts and superior distractor linguistic consistency and semantic plausibility, particularly for inferential questions. These findings demonstrate that hybrid, agentic orchestration can systematically improve the reliability and controllability of LLM-based generation, highlighting workflow design as a key lever for structured artifact generation beyond single-pass prompting.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03702](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03702)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models are increasingly trained in continual or open-ended settings, where the total training horizon is not known in advance. Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining.

## 61. Agent Primitives: Reusable Latent Building Blocks for Multi-Agent Systems
- **Authors**: Haibo Jin , Kuang Peng , Ye Yu , Xiaopeng Yuan , Haohan Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03695)
- **Abstract**:
> While existing multi-agent systems (MAS) can handle complex problems by enabling collaboration among multiple agents, they are often highly task-specific, relying on manually crafted agent roles and interaction prompts, which leads to increased architectural complexity and limited reusability across tasks. Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories. In this work, we propose \textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS. Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\times$-4$\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\times$-1.6$\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones.

## 62. LLM-Inspired Pretrain-Then-Finetune for Small-Data, Large-Scale Optimization
- **Authors**: Zishi Zhang , Jinhui Han , Ming Hu , Yijie Peng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03690](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03690)
- **Abstract**:
> We consider small-data, large-scale decision problems in which a firm must make many operational decisions simultaneously (e.g., across a large product portfolio) while observing only a few, potentially noisy, data points per instance. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we propose a pretrain-then-finetune approach built on a designed Transformer model to address this challenge. The model is first pretrained on large-scale, domain-informed synthetic data that encode managerial knowledge and structural features of the decision environment, and is then fine-tuned on real observations. This new pipeline offers two complementary advantages: pretraining injects domain knowledge into the learning process and enables the training of high-capacity models using abundant synthetic data, while finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the operational environment and improves alignment with the true data-generating regime. While we have leveraged the Transformer's state-of-the-art representational capacity, particularly its attention mechanism, to efficiently extract cross-task structure, our approach is not an off-the-shelf application. Instead, it relies on problem-specific architectural design and a tailored training procedure to match the decision setting. Theoretically, we develop the first comprehensive error analysis regarding Transformer learning in relevant contexts, establishing nonasymptotic guarantees that validate the method's effectiveness. Critically, our analysis reveals how pretraining and fine-tuning jointly determine performance, with the dominant contribution governed by whichever is more favorable. In particular, finetuning exhibits an economies-of-scale effect, whereby transfer learning becomes increasingly effective as the number of instances grows.

## 63. Universal One-third Time Scaling in Learning Peaked Distributions
- **Authors**: Yizhou Liu , Ziming Liu , Cengiz Pehlevan , Jeff Gore
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03685)
- **Abstract**:
> Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, partly because the loss exhibits slow power-law convergence whose origin remains debatable. Through systematic analysis of toy models and empirical evaluation of LLMs, we show that this behavior can arise intrinsically from the use of softmax and cross-entropy. When learning peaked probability distributions, e.g., next-token distributions, these components yield power-law vanishing losses and gradients, creating a fundamental optimization bottleneck. This ultimately leads to power-law time scaling of the loss with a universal exponent of $1/3$. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for observed neural scaling and suggest new directions for improving LLM training efficiency.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03652](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03652)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM factuality, yet design guidance remains English-centric, limiting insights for morphologically rich languages like Turkish. We address this by constructing a comprehensive Turkish RAG dataset derived from Turkish Wikipedia and CulturaX, comprising question-answer pairs and relevant passage chunks. We benchmark seven stages of the RAG pipeline, from query transformation and reranking to answer refinement, without task-specific fine-tuning. Our results show that complex methods like HyDE maximize accuracy (85%) that is considerably higher than the baseline (78.70%). Also a Pareto-optimal configuration using Cross-encoder Reranking and Context Augmentation achieves comparable performance (84.60%) with much lower cost. We further demonstrate that over-stacking generative modules can degrade performance by distorting morphological cues, whereas simple query clarification with robust reranking offers an effective solution.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03633](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03633)
- **Abstract**:
> Text-to-SQL systems have achieved strong performance on English benchmarks, yet their behavior in morphologically rich, low-resource languages remains largely unexplored. We introduce BIRDTurk, the first Turkish adaptation of the BIRD benchmark, constructed through a controlled translation pipeline that adapts schema identifiers to Turkish while strictly preserving the logical structure and execution semantics of SQL queries and databases. Translation quality is validated on a sample size determined by the Central Limit Theorem to ensure 95% confidence, achieving 98.15% accuracy on human-evaluated samples. Using BIRDTurk, we evaluate inference-based prompting, agentic multi-stage reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. Our results reveal that Turkish introduces consistent performance degradation, driven by both structural linguistic divergence and underrepresentation in LLM pretraining, while agentic reasoning demonstrates stronger cross-lingual robustness. Supervised fine-tuning remains challenging for standard multilingual baselines but scales effectively with modern instruction-tuned models. BIRDTurk provides a controlled testbed for cross-lingual Text-to-SQL evaluation under realistic database conditions. We release the training and development splits to support future research.

## 66. Controlling Output Rankings in Generative Engines for LLM-based Search
- **Authors**: Haibo Jin , Ruoxi Chen , Peiyan Zhang , Yifeng Luo , Huimin Zeng , Man Luo , Haohan Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03608](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03608)
- **Abstract**:
> The way customers search for and choose products is changing with the rise of large language models (LLMs). LLM-based search, or generative engines, provides direct product recommendations to users, rather than traditional online search results that require users to explore options themselves. However, these recommendations are strongly influenced by the initial retrieval order of LLMs, which disadvantages small businesses and independent creators by limiting their visibility. In this work, we propose CORE, an optimization method that \textbf{C}ontrols \textbf{O}utput \textbf{R}ankings in g\textbf{E}nerative Engines for LLM-based search. Since the LLM's interactions with the search engine are black-box, CORE targets the content returned by search engines as the primary means of influencing output rankings. Specifically, CORE optimizes retrieved content by appending strategically designed optimization content to steer the ranking of outputs. We introduce three types of optimization content: string-based, reasoning-based, and review-based, demonstrating their effectiveness in shaping output rankings. To evaluate CORE in realistic settings, we introduce ProductBench, a large-scale benchmark with 15 product categories and 200 products per category, where each product is associated with its top-10 recommendations collected from Amazon's search interface. Extensive experiments on four LLMs with search capabilities (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, Claude-4, and Grok-3) demonstrate that CORE achieves an average Promotion Success Rate of \textbf{91.4\% @Top-5}, \textbf{86.6\% @Top-3}, and \textbf{80.3\% @Top-1}, across 15 product categories, outperforming existing ranking manipulation methods while preserving the fluency of optimized content.

In the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Actor-Critic methods (e.g., PPO), this baseline is typically estimated by a Value Model (Critic) often as large as the policy model itself. However, as the policy continuously evolves, the value model requires expensive, synchronous incremental training to accurately track the shifting capabilities of the policy. To avoid this overhead, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) eliminates the coupled value model by using the average reward of a group of rollouts as the baseline; yet, this approach necessitates extensive sampling to maintain estimation stability. In this paper, we propose $V_0$, a Generalist Value Model capable of estimating the expected performance of any model on unseen prompts without requiring parameter updates. We reframe value estimation by treating the policy's dynamic capability as an explicit context input; specifically, we leverage a history of instruction-performance pairs to dynamically profile the model, departing from the traditional paradigm that relies on parameter fitting to perceive capability shifts. Focusing on value estimation at State Zero (i.e., the initial prompt, hence $V_0$), our model serves as a critical resource scheduler. During GRPO training, $V_0$ predicts success rates prior to rollout, allowing for efficient sampling budget allocation; during deployment, it functions as a router, dispatching instructions to the most cost-effective and suitable model. Empirical results demonstrate that $V_0$ significantly outperforms heuristic budget allocation and achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and cost in LLM routing tasks.

## 68. Don't believe everything you read: Understanding and Measuring MCP Behavior under Misleading Tool Descriptions
- **Authors**: Zhihao Li , Boyang Ma , Xuelong Dai , Minghui Xu , Yue Zhang , Biwei Yan , Kun Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03580](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03580)
- **Abstract**:
> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models to invoke external tools through natural-language descriptions, forming the foundation of many AI agent applications. However, MCP does not enforce consistency between documented tool behavior and actual code execution, even though MCP Servers often run with broad system privileges. This gap introduces a largely unexplored security risk. We study how mismatches between externally presented tool descriptions and underlying implementations systematically shape the mental models and decision-making behavior of intelligent agents. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study of description-code inconsistency in the MCP ecosystem. We design an automated static analysis framework and apply it to 10,240 real-world MCP Servers across 36 categories. Our results show that while most servers are highly consistent, approximately 13% exhibit substantial mismatches that can enable undocumented privileged operations, hidden state mutations, or unauthorized financial actions. We further observe systematic differences across application categories, popularity levels, and MCP marketplaces. Our findings demonstrate that description-code inconsistency is a concrete and prevalent attack surface in MCP-based AI agents, and motivate the need for systematic auditing and stronger transparency guarantees in future agent ecosystems.

## 69. Use Graph When It Needs: Efficiently and Adaptively Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Graphs
- **Authors**: Su Dong , Qinggang Zhang , Yilin Xiao , Shengyuan Chen , Chuang Zhou , Xiao Huang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03578](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03578)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external corpora, its effectiveness is limited by fragmented information in unstructured domain documents. Graph-augmented RAG (GraphRAG) emerged to enhance contextual reasoning through structured knowledge graphs, yet paradoxically underperforms vanilla RAG in real-world scenarios, exhibiting significant accuracy drops and prohibitive latency despite gains on complex queries. We identify the rigid application of GraphRAG to all queries, regardless of complexity, as the root cause. To resolve this, we propose an efficient and adaptive GraphRAG framework called EA-GraphRAG that dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG paradigms through syntax-aware complexity analysis. Our approach introduces: (i) a syntactic feature constructor that parses each query and extracts a set of structural features; (ii) a lightweight complexity scorer that maps these features to a continuous complexity score; and (iii) a score-driven routing policy that selects dense RAG for low-score queries, invokes graph-based retrieval for high-score queries, and applies complexity-aware reciprocal rank fusion to handle borderline cases. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark, consisting of two single-hop and two multi-hop QA benchmarks, demonstrate that our EA-GraphRAG significantly improves accuracy, reduces latency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling mixed scenarios involving both simple and complex queries.

- **Abstract**:
> Recent progress has expanded the use of large language models (LLMs) in drug discovery, including synthesis planning. However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices. We also introduce CREED, a novel dataset comprising millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training, and use it to train a model that improves over the LLM baselines under this benchmark.

- **Authors**: Zixiang Di , Jinyi Han , Shuo Zhang , Ying Liao , Zhi Li , Xiaofeng Ji , Yongqi Wang , Zheming Yang , Ming Gao , Bingdong Li , Jie Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03516](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03516)
- **Abstract**:
> Learning from negative samples holds great promise for improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capability, yet existing methods treat all incorrect responses as equally informative, overlooking the crucial role of sample quality. To address this, we propose Plausible Negative Samples (PNS), a method that synthesizes high-quality negative samples exhibiting expected format and structural coherence while ultimately yielding incorrect answers. PNS trains a dedicated model via reverse reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation, generating responses nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions. We further validate PNS as a plug-and-play data source for preference optimization across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Results demonstrate that PNS consistently outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models.

## 72. Mitigating Staleness in Asynchronous Pipeline Parallelism via Basis Rotation
- **Authors**: Hyunji Jung , Sungbin Shin , Namhoon Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03515](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03515)
- **Abstract**:
> Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline.

## 73. Self-Verification Dilemma: Experience-Driven Suppression of Overused Checking in LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Quanyu Long , Kai Jie Jiang , Jianda Chen , Xu Guo , Leilei Gan , Wenya Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03485](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03485)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by generating long reasoning traces with reflection. Through a large-scale empirical analysis, we find that a substantial fraction of reflective steps consist of self-verification (recheck) that repeatedly confirm intermediate results. These rechecks occur frequently across models and benchmarks, yet the vast majority are confirmatory rather than corrective, rarely identifying errors and altering reasoning outcomes. This reveals a mismatch between how often self-verification is activated and how often it is actually useful. Motivated by this, we propose a novel, experience-driven test-time framework that reduces the overused verification. Our method detects the activation of recheck behavior, consults an offline experience pool of past verification outcomes, and estimates whether a recheck is likely unnecessary via efficient retrieval. When historical experience suggests unnecessary, a suppression signal redirects the model to proceed. Across multiple model and benchmarks, our approach reduces token usage up to 20.3% while maintaining the accuracy, and in some datasets even yields accuracy improvements.

## 74. Beyond Variance: Prompt-Efficient RLVR via Rare-Event Amplification and Bidirectional Pairing
- **Authors**: Xin Sheng , Jiaxin Li , Yujuan Pang , Ran Peng , Yong Ma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03452](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03452)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective for training large language models on deterministic outcome reasoning tasks. Prior work shows RLVR works with few prompts, but prompt selection is often based only on training-accuracy variance, leading to unstable optimization directions and weaker transfer. We revisit prompt selection from a mechanism-level view and argue that an effective minibatch should provide both (i) a reliable positive anchor and (ii) explicit negative learning signals from rare failures. Based on this principle, we propose \emph{positive--negative pairing}: at each update, we sample a hard-but-solvable $q^{+}$ and an easy-but-brittle prompt $q^{-}$(high success rate but not perfect), characterized by low and high empirical success rates under multiple rollouts. We further introduce Weighted GRPO, which reweights binary outcomes at the pair level and uses group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes on $q^{+}$ into sharp positive guidance while turning rare failures on $q^{-}$ into strong negative penalties. This bidirectional signal provides informative learning feedback for both successes and failures, improving sample efficiency without suppressing exploration. On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, a single paired minibatch per update consistently outperforms a GRPO baseline that selects two prompts via commonly used variance-based selection heuristics: AIME~2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, and AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0, while remaining competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from a pool of 1209 training prompts. Similar gains are observed on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct.

## 75. Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance for Multi-Subject Image Generation
- **Authors**: Yijia Xu , Zihao Wang , Jinshi Cui
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03448)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize images that faithfully preserve the identities of multiple reference subjects while following textual instructions. However, existing methods often suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control, as they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), a framework that provides explicit, structured supervision from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances. At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This module restricts each text token to attend only to its matched reference regions, ensuring precise attribute binding and reliable multi-subject composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-subject image generation, substantially improving prompt following and subject consistency.

- **Authors**: Zhengbo Jiao , Shaobo Wang , Zifan Zhang , Wei Wang , Bing Zhao , Hu Wei , Linfeng Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03414](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03414)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced vision-language understanding. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle with geometric reasoning, revealing a critical bottleneck: the extreme scarcity of high-quality image-text pairs. Human annotation is prohibitively expensive, while automated methods fail to ensure fidelity and training effectiveness. Existing approaches either passively adapt to available images or employ inefficient random exploration with filtering, decoupling generation from learning needs. We propose Socratic-Geo, a fully autonomous framework that dynamically couples data synthesis with model learning through multi-agent interaction. The Teacher agent generates parameterized Python scripts with reflective feedback (Reflect for solvability, RePI for visual validity), ensuring image-text pair purity. The Solver agent optimizes reasoning through preference learning, with failure paths guiding Teacher's targeted augmentation. Independently, the Generator learns image generation capabilities on accumulated "image-code-instruction" triplets, distilling programmatic drawing intelligence into visual generation. Starting from only 108 seed problems, Socratic-Solver achieves 49.11 on six benchmarks using one-quarter of baseline data, surpassing strong baselines by 2.43 points. Socratic-Generator achieves 42.4% on GenExam, establishing new state-of-the-art for open-source models, surpassing Seedream-4.0 (39.8%) and approaching Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image (43.1%).

## 77. Precision in Practice: Knowledge Guided Code Summarizing Grounded in Industrial Expectations
- **Authors**: Jintai Li , Songqiang Chen , Shuo Jin , Xiaoyuan Xie
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03400](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03400)
- **Abstract**:
> Code summaries are essential for helping developers understand code functionality and reducing maintenance and collaboration costs. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic code summarization, the practical usefulness of generated summaries in industrial settings remains insufficiently explored. In collaboration with documentation experts from the industrial HarmonyOS project, we conducted a questionnaire study showing that over 57.4% of code summaries produced by state-of-the-art approaches were rejected due to violations of developers' expectations for industrial documentation. Beyond semantic similarity to reference summaries, developers emphasize additional requirements, including the use of appropriate domain terminology, explicit function categorization, and the avoidance of redundant implementation details. To address these expectations, we propose ExpSum, an expectation-aware code summarization approach that integrates function metadata abstraction, informative metadata filtering, context-aware domain knowledge retrieval, and constraint-driven prompting to guide LLMs in generating structured, expectation-aligned summaries. We evaluate ExpSum on the HarmonyOS project and widely used code summarization benchmarks. Experimental results show that ExpSum consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving improvements of up to 26.71% in BLEU-4 and 20.10% in ROUGE-L on HarmonyOS. Furthermore, LLM-based evaluations indicate that ExpSum-generated summaries better align with developer expectations across other projects, demonstrating its effectiveness for industrial code documentation.

## 78. On the Entropy Dynamics in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Shumin Wang , Yuexiang Xie , Wenhao Zhang , Yuchang Sun , Yanxi Chen , Yaliang Li , Yanyong Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03392](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03392)
- **Abstract**:
> Entropy serves as a critical metric for measuring the diversity of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), providing valuable insights into their exploration capabilities. While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning.

## 79. MeKi: Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection for Efficient LLM Scaling
- **Authors**: Ning Ding , Fangcheng Liu , Kyungrae Kim , Linji Hao , Kyeng-Hun Lee , Hyeonmok Ko , Yehui Tang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03359](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03359)
- **Abstract**:
> Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) typically relies on increasing the number of parameters or test-time computations to boost performance. However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at this https URL .

- **Authors**: Shengyuan Liu , Liuxin Bao , Qi Yang , Wanting Geng , Boyun Zheng , Chenxin Li , Wenting Chen , Houwen Peng , Yixuan Yuan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03320](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03320)
- **Abstract**:
> Medical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

## 81. Entropy-Gated Selective Policy Optimization:Token-Level Gradient Allocation for Hybrid Training of Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Yuelin Hu , Zhengxue Cheng , Wei Liu , Li Song
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03309)
- **Abstract**:
> Hybrid training methods for large language models combine supervised fine tuning (SFT) on expert demonstrations with reinforcement learning (RL) on model rollouts, typically at the sample level. We propose Entropy Gated Selective Policy Optimization (EGSPO), a three stage framework that extends sample level mixing with token level gradient modulation. Stage 1, SFT expert learning, establishes a reliable warm up policy using expert demonstrations with a pure SFT loss. Stage 2, RL rollout generation, samples trajectories from the current policy and computes per token predictive entropy. Stage 3, the EGSPO mechanism, applies entropy gated gradient allocation: a predictive entropy module routes high entropy tokens to full PPO updates to encourage exploration, and low entropy tokens to attenuated PPO updates to reduce variance and preserve knowledge. Critically, both branches incorporate the advantage function A_t, ensuring that incorrect trajectories receive consistent negative learning signals and preventing reinforcement of confident errors. EGSPO achieves consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with gains of 3.8 percent on AIME and 2.9 percent on MATH over the CHORD phi baseline, while incurring only 3.4 percent additional computational overhead.

## 82. R1-SyntheticVL: Is Synthetic Data from Generative Models Ready for Multimodal Large Language Model?
- **Authors**: Jingyi Zhang , Tianyi Lin , Huanjin Yao , Xiang Lan , Shunyu Liu , Jiaxing Huang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03300)
- **Abstract**:
> In this work, we aim to develop effective data synthesis techniques that autonomously synthesize multimodal training data for enhancing MLLMs in solving complex real-world tasks. To this end, we propose Collective Adversarial Data Synthesis (CADS), a novel and general approach to synthesize high-quality, diverse and challenging multimodal data for MLLMs. The core idea of CADS is to leverage collective intelligence to ensure high-quality and diverse generation, while exploring adversarial learning to synthesize challenging samples for effectively driving model improvement. Specifically, CADS operates with two cyclic phases, i.e., Collective Adversarial Data Generation (CAD-Generate) and Collective Adversarial Data Judgment (CAD-Judge). CAD-Generate leverages collective knowledge to jointly generate new and diverse multimodal data, while CAD-Judge collaboratively assesses the quality of synthesized data. In addition, CADS introduces an Adversarial Context Optimization mechanism to optimize the generation context to encourage challenging and high-value data generation. With CADS, we construct MMSynthetic-20K and train our model R1-SyntheticVL, which demonstrates superior performance on various benchmarks.

## 83. POP: Prefill-Only Pruning for Efficient Large Model Inference
- **Authors**: Junhui He , Zhihui Fu , Jun Wang , Qingan Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03295](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03295)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. Existing structured pruning methods, while hardware-efficient, often suffer from significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we argue that this failure stems from a stage-agnostic pruning approach that overlooks the asymmetric roles between the prefill and decode stages. By introducing a virtual gate mechanism, our importance analysis reveals that deep layers are critical for next-token prediction (decode) but largely redundant for context encoding (prefill). Leveraging this insight, we propose Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), a stage-aware inference strategy that safely omits deep layers during the computationally intensive prefill stage while retaining the full model for the sensitive decode stage. To enable the transition between stages, we introduce independent Key-Value (KV) projections to maintain cache integrity, and a boundary handling strategy to ensure the accuracy of the first generated token. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma-3 across diverse modalities demonstrate that POP achieves up to 1.37$\times$ speedup in prefill latency with minimal performance loss, effectively overcoming the accuracy-efficiency trade-off limitations of existing structured pruning methods.

## 84. ATACompressor: Adaptive Task-Aware Compression for Efficient Long-Context Processing in LLMs
- **Authors**: Xuancheng Li , Haitao Li , Yujia Zhou , Qingyao Ai , Yiqun Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03226)
- **Abstract**:
> Long-context inputs in large language models (LLMs) often suffer from the "lost in the middle" problem, where critical information becomes diluted or ignored due to excessive length. Context compression methods aim to address this by reducing input size, but existing approaches struggle with balancing information preservation and compression efficiency. We propose Adaptive Task-Aware Compressor (ATACompressor), which dynamically adjusts compression based on the specific requirements of the task. ATACompressor employs a selective encoder that compresses only the task-relevant portions of long contexts, ensuring that essential information is preserved while reducing unnecessary content. Its adaptive allocation controller perceives the length of relevant content and adjusts the compression rate accordingly, optimizing resource utilization. We evaluate ATACompressor on three QA datasets: HotpotQA, MSMARCO, and SQUAD-showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both compression efficiency and task performance. Our approach provides a scalable solution for long-context processing in LLMs. Furthermore, we perform a range of ablation studies and analysis experiments to gain deeper insights into the key components of ATACompressor.

## 85. Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens for Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Jing-Cheng Pang , Liang Lu , Xian Tang , Kun Jiang , Sijie Wu , Kai Zhang , Xubin Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03195](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03195)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key paradigm for aligning and optimizing large language models (LLMs). Standard approaches treat the LLM as the policy and apply RL directly over the full vocabulary space. However, this formulation includes the massive tail of contextually irrelevant tokens in the action space, which could distract the policy from focusing on decision-making among the truly reasonable tokens. In this work, we verify that valid reasoning paths could inherently concentrate within a low-rank subspace. Based on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens (RLPT), a framework that mitigates the action space issue by decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation. Specifically, RLPT leverages the semantic priors of the base model to identify a dynamic set of \emph{promising tokens} and constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that RLPT effectively reduces gradient variance, stabilizes the training process, and improves sample efficiency. Experiment results on math, coding, and telecom reasoning show that RLPT outperforms standard RL baselines and integrates effectively across various model sizes (4B and 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO and DAPO).

## 86. Prompt Augmentation Scales up GRPO Training on Mathematical Reasoning
- **Authors**: Wenquan Lu , Hai Huang , Randall Balestriero
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03190](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03190)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement learning algorithms such as group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated strong potential for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench.

- **Abstract**:
> Research involving privacy-sensitive data has always been constrained by data scarcity, standing in sharp contrast to other areas that have benefited from data scaling. This challenge is becoming increasingly urgent as modern AI agents--such as OpenClaw and Gemini Agent--are granted persistent access to highly sensitive personal information. To tackle this longstanding bottleneck and the rising risks, we present Privasis (i.e., privacy oasis), the first million-scale fully synthetic dataset entirely built from scratch--an expansive reservoir of texts with rich and diverse private information--designed to broaden and accelerate research in areas where processing sensitive social data is inevitable. Compared to existing datasets, Privasis, comprising 1.4 million records, offers orders-of-magnitude larger scale with quality, and far greater diversity across various document types, including medical history, legal documents, financial records, calendars, and text messages with a total of 55.1 million annotated attributes such as ethnicity, date of birth, workplace, etc. We leverage Privasis to construct a parallel corpus for text sanitization with our pipeline that decomposes texts and applies targeted sanitization. Our compact sanitization models (<=4B) trained on this dataset outperform state-of-the-art large language models, such as GPT-5 and Qwen-3 235B. We plan to release data, models, and code to accelerate future research on privacy-sensitive domains and agents.

- **Authors**: Xiaoyu Tao , Mingyue Cheng , Ze Guo , Shuo Yu , Yaguo Liu , Qi Liu , Shijin Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03164](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03164)
- **Abstract**:
> Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a critical role in decision-making for many real-world applications. Recently, LLM-based forecasters have made promising advancements. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods often lack explicit experience accumulation and continual evolution. In this work, we propose MemCast, a learning-to-memory framework that reformulates TSF as an experience-conditioned reasoning task. Specifically, we learn experience from the training set and organize it into a hierarchical memory. This is achieved by summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing extracted temporal features into general laws. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage historical patterns to guide the reasoning process and utilize reasoning wisdom to select better trajectories, while general laws serve as criteria for reflective iteration. Additionally, to enable continual evolution, we design a dynamic confidence adaptation strategy that updates the confidence of individual entries without leaking the test set distribution.

## 89. Internet of Agentic AI: Incentive-Compatible Distributed Teaming and Workflow
- **Authors**: Ya-Ting Yang , Quanyan Zhu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03145](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03145)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of agentic AI systems that reason, plan, and act by invoking external tools. However, most existing agentic architectures remain centralized and monolithic, limiting scalability, specialization, and interoperability. This paper proposes a framework for scalable agentic intelligence, termed the Internet of Agentic AI, in which autonomous, heterogeneous agents distributed across cloud and edge infrastructure dynamically form coalitions to execute task-driven workflows. We formalize a network-native model of agentic collaboration and introduce an incentive-compatible workflow-coalition feasibility framework that integrates capability coverage, network locality, and economic implementability. To enable scalable coordination, we formulate a minimum-effort coalition selection problem and propose a decentralized coalition formation algorithm. The proposed framework can operate as a coordination layer above the Model Context Protocol (MCP). A healthcare case study demonstrates how domain specialization, cloud-edge heterogeneity, and dynamic coalition formation enable scalable, resilient, and economically viable agentic workflows. This work lays the foundation for principled coordination and scalability in the emerging era of Internet of Agentic AI.

## 90. Self-Hinting Language Models Enhance Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Baohao Liao , Hanze Dong , Xinxing Xu , Christof Monz , Jiang Bian
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03143](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03143)
- **Abstract**:
> Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has recently emerged as a practical recipe for aligning large language models with verifiable objectives. However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $\tau$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,\tau)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

## 91. SwiftVLM: Efficient Vision-Language Model Inference via Cross-Layer Token Bypass
- **Authors**: Chen Qian , Xinran Yu , Danyang Li , Guoxuan Chi , Zheng Yang , Qiang Ma , Xin Miao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03134](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03134)
- **Abstract**:
> Visual token pruning is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of vision-language models (VLMs), and existing methods often rely on early pruning decisions to improve efficiency. While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior.

## 92. Contrastive Concept-Tree Search for LLM-Assisted Algorithm Discovery
- **Authors**: Timothee Leleu , Sudeera Gunathilaka , Federico Ghimenti , Surya Ganguli
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03132](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03132)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language Model (LLM)-assisted algorithm discovery is an iterative, black-box optimization process over programs to approximatively solve a target task, where an LLM proposes candidate programs and an external evaluator provides task feedback. Despite intense recent research on the topic and promising results, how can the LLM internal representation of the space of possible programs be maximally exploited to improve performance is an open question. Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erdős-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid. We further validate these findings in a controlled synthetic algorithm-discovery environment, which reproduces qualitatively the search dynamics observed with the LLMs.

## 93. Quantized Evolution Strategies: High-precision Fine-tuning of Quantized LLMs at Low-precision Cost
- **Authors**: Yinggan Xu , Risto Miikkulainen , Xin Qiu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03120](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03120)
- **Abstract**:
> Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on memory-constrained devices, yet it renders models static and difficult to fine-tune. Standard fine-tuning paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), fundamentally rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights to compute gradients. Thus they cannot be used on quantized models, where the parameter space is discrete and non-differentiable. While Evolution Strategies (ES) offer a backpropagation-free alternative, optimization of the quantized parameters can still fail due to vanishing or inaccurate gradient. This paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), an optimization paradigm that performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in the quantized space. QES is based on two innovations: (1) it integrates accumulated error feedback to preserve high-precision gradient signals, and (2) it utilizes a stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels. QES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning method on arithmetic reasoning tasks, making direct fine-tuning for quantized models possible. It therefore opens up the possibility for scaling up LLMs entirely in the quantized space. The source code is available at this https URL .

- **Abstract**:
> Rapid innovations in AI and large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the adoption of digital learning, particularly beyond formal education. What began as an emergency response during COVID-19 has shifted from a supplementary resource to an essential pillar of education. Understanding how digital learning continues to evolve for adult and lifelong learners is therefore increasingly important. This study examines how various demographics interact with digital learning platforms, focusing on the learner motivations, the effectiveness of gamification in digital learning, and the integration of AI. Using multi survey data from 200 respondents and advanced analytics, our findings reveal a notable increase in the perceived relevance of digital learning after the pandemic, especially among young adults and women, coinciding with the rise of LLM-powered AI tools that support personalized learning. We aim to provide actionable insights for businesses, government policymakers, and educators seeking to optimize their digital learning offerings to meet evolving workforce needs.

## 95. Task--Specificity Score: Measuring How Much Instructions Really Matter for Supervision
- **Authors**: Pritam Kadasi , Abhishek Upperwal , Mayank Singh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03103)
- **Abstract**:
> Instruction tuning is now the default way to train and adapt large language models, but many instruction--input--output pairs are only weakly specified: for a given input, the same output can remain plausible under several alternative instructions. This raises a simple question: \emph{does the instruction uniquely determine the target output?} We propose the \textbf{Task--Specificity Score (TSS)} to quantify how much an instruction matters for predicting its output, by contrasting the true instruction against plausible alternatives for the same input. We further introduce \textbf{TSS++}, which uses hard alternatives and a small quality term to mitigate easy-negative effects. Across three instruction datasets (\textsc{Alpaca}, \textsc{Dolly-15k}, \textsc{NI-20}) and three open LLMs (Gemma, Llama, Qwen), we show that selecting task-specific examples improves downstream performance under tight token budgets and complements quality-based filters such as perplexity and IFD.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03098](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03098)
- **Abstract**:
> Expanding multimodal representations to novel modalities is constrained by reliance on large-scale paired datasets (e.g., text-image, text-audio, text-3D, text-molecule), which are costly and often infeasible in domains requiring expert annotation such as medical imaging and molecular analysis. We introduce TextME, the first text-only modality expansion framework, to the best of our knowledge, projecting diverse modalities into LLM embedding space as a unified anchor. Our approach exploits the geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer using only text descriptions, without paired supervision. We empirically validate that such consistent modality gaps exist across image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, and molecular domains, demonstrating that text-only training can preserve substantial performance of pretrained encoders. We further show that our framework enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between modality pairs not explicitly aligned during training (e.g., audio-to-image, 3D-to-image). These results establish text-only training as a practical alternative to paired supervision for modality expansion.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03085](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03085)
- **Abstract**:
> Detecting whether a model has been poisoned is a longstanding problem in AI security. In this work, we present a practical scanner for identifying sleeper agent-style backdoors in causal language models. Our approach relies on two key findings: first, sleeper agents tend to memorize poisoning data, making it possible to leak backdoor examples using memory extraction techniques. Second, poisoned LLMs exhibit distinctive patterns in their output distributions and attention heads when backdoor triggers are present in the input. Guided by these observations, we develop a scalable backdoor scanning methodology that assumes no prior knowledge of the trigger or target behavior and requires only inference operations. Our scanner integrates naturally into broader defensive strategies and does not alter model performance. We show that our method recovers working triggers across multiple backdoor scenarios and a broad range of models and fine-tuning methods.

## 98. Evaluating LLMs When They Do Not Know the Answer: Statistical Evaluation of Mathematical Reasoning via Comparative Signals
- **Authors**: Zihan Dong , Zhixian Zhang , Yang Zhou , Can Jin , Ruijia Wu , Linjun Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03061](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03061)
- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating mathematical reasoning in LLMs is constrained by limited benchmark sizes and inherent model stochasticity, yielding high-variance accuracy estimates and unstable rankings across platforms. On difficult problems, an LLM may fail to produce a correct final answer, yet still provide reliable pairwise comparison signals indicating which of two candidate solutions is better. We leverage this observation to design a statistically efficient evaluation framework that combines standard labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals obtained by having models judge auxiliary reasoning chains. Treating these comparison signals as control variates, we develop a semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) for the setting where auxiliary reasoning chains are observed. This yields a one-step estimator that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, guarantees strict variance reduction over naive sample averaging, and admits asymptotic normality for principled uncertainty quantification. Across simulations, our one-step estimator substantially improves ranking accuracy, with gains increasing as model output noise grows. Experiments on GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, and GSM8K further demonstrate more precise performance estimation and more reliable model rankings, especially in small-sample regimes where conventional evaluation is pretty unstable.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03048](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03048)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key approach for enhancing LLM this http URL , standard frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) typically employ a uniform rollout budget, leading to resource inefficiency. Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03038](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03038)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made great strides in everyday visual tasks, such as captioning a natural image, or answering commonsense questions about such images. But humans possess the puzzling ability to deploy their visual reasoning abilities in radically new situations, a skill rigorously tested by the classic set of visual reasoning challenges known as the Bongard problems. We present a neurosymbolic approach to solving these problems: given a hypothesized solution rule for a Bongard problem, we leverage LLMs to generate parameterized programmatic representations for the rule and perform parameter fitting using Bayesian optimization. We evaluate our method on classifying Bongard problem images given the ground truth rule, as well as on solving the problems from scratch.

## 101. FedKRSO: Communication and Memory Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Guohao Yang , Tongle Wu , Yuanxiong Guo , Ying Sun , Yanmin Gong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03019)
- **Abstract**:
> Fine-tuning is essential to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific tasks. As a privacy-preserving framework to leverage decentralized data for collaborative model training, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity in LLM fine-tuning, but remains challenging due to the high cost of transmitting full model parameters and computing full gradients on resource-constrained clients. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used in FL to reduce communication and memory costs, they often sacrifice model performance compared to FFT. This paper proposes FedKRSO (Federated $K$-Seed Random Subspace Optimization), a novel method that enables communication and memory efficient FFT of LLMs in federated settings. In FedKRSO, clients update the model within a shared set of random low-dimension subspaces generated by the server to save memory usage. Furthermore, instead of transmitting full model parameters in each FL round, clients send only the model update accumulators along the subspaces to the server, enabling efficient global model aggregation and dissemination. By using these strategies, FedKRSO can substantially reduce communication and memory overhead while overcoming the performance limitations of PEFT, closely approximating the performance of federated FFT. The convergence properties of FedKRSO are analyzed rigorously under general FL settings. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark across diverse FL scenarios demonstrate that FedKRSO achieves both superior performance and low communication and memory overhead, paving the way towards on federated LLM fine-tuning at the resource-constrained edge.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03007](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03007)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite significant costs from retrieving and processing high-fidelity visual inputs, most multimodal vision-language systems operate at fixed fidelity levels. We introduce VOILA, a framework for Value-Of-Information-driven adaptive fidelity selection in Visual Question Answering (VQA) that optimizes what information to retrieve before model execution. Given a query, VOILA uses a two-stage pipeline: a gradient-boosted regressor estimates correctness likelihood at each fidelity from question features alone, then an isotonic calibrator refines these probabilities for reliable decision-making. The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters. VOILA consistently achieves 50-60% cost reductions while retaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy across diverse query types and model architectures, demonstrating that pre-retrieval fidelity selection is vital to optimize multimodal inference under resource constraints.

## 103. NLI:Non-uniform Linear Interpolation Approximation of Nonlinear Operations for Efficient LLMs Inference
- **Authors**: Jiangyong Yu , Xiaomeng Han , Xing Hu , Chen Xu , Zhe Jiang , Dawei Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02988)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their deployment is often constrained by substantial memory footprints and computational costs. While prior work has achieved significant progress in compressing and accelerating linear layers, nonlinear layers-such as SiLU, RMSNorm, and Softmax-still heavily depend on high-precision floating-point operations. In this paper, we propose a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal, and hardware-friendly framework called Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI). NLI is capable of efficiently approximating a variety of nonlinear functions, enabling seamless integration into LLMs and other deep neural networks with almost no loss in accuracy. NLI ingeniously recasts cutpoint selection as a dynamic-programming problem, achieving the globally minimal interpolation error in O(MxN2) time via Bellman's optimality principle. Based on the NLI algorithm, we also design and implement a plug-and-play universal nonlinear computation unit. Hardware experiments demonstrate that the NLI Engine achieves more than 4x improvement in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art designs.

## 104. Aligning Forest and Trees in Images and Long Captions for Visually Grounded Understanding
- **Authors**: Byeongju Woo , Zilin Wang , Byeonghyun Pak , Sangwoo Mo , Stella X. Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02977](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02977)
- **Abstract**:
> Large vision-language models such as CLIP struggle with long captions because they align images and texts as undifferentiated wholes. Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains. Yet linguistic hierarchies from syntax or semantics rarely match visual organization, and purely visual hierarchies tend to fragment scenes into appearance-driven parts without semantic focus. We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision.

## 105. Where Norms and References Collide: Evaluating LLMs on Normative Reasoning
- **Authors**: Mitchell Abrams , Kaveh Eskandari Miandoab , Felix Gervits , Vasanth Sarathy , Matthias Scheutz
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02975](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02975)
- **Abstract**:
> Embodied agents, such as robots, will need to interact in situated environments where successful communication often depends on reasoning over social norms: shared expectations that constrain what actions are appropriate in context. A key capability in such settings is norm-based reference resolution (NBRR), where interpreting referential expressions requires inferring implicit normative expectations grounded in physical and social context. Yet it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support this kind of reasoning. In this work, we introduce SNIC (Situated Norms in Context), a human-validated diagnostic testbed designed to probe how well state-of-the-art LLMs can extract and utilize normative principles relevant to NBRR. SNIC emphasizes physically grounded norms that arise in everyday tasks such as cleaning, tidying, and serving. Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict. These findings reveal a blind spot in current LLMs and highlight a key challenge for deploying language-based systems in socially situated, embodied settings.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02951](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02951)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision token pruning has proven to be an effective acceleration technique for the efficient Vision Language Model (VLM). However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks. Our analysis of the VLM's processing pipeline reveals that strategies utilizing global semantic similarity and attention scores lose the global spatial reference frame, which is derived from the interactions of tokens' positional information. Motivated by these findings, we propose $\text{Nüwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\text{Nüwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%).

- **Authors**: Alireza Amiri-Margavi , Arshia Gharagozlou , Amin Gholami Davodi , Seyed Pouyan Mousavi Davoudi , Hamidreza Hasani Balyani
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02932](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02932)
- **Abstract**:
> Prior work on fairness in large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on access-level behaviors such as refusals and safety filtering. However, equitable access does not ensure equitable interaction quality once a response is provided. In this paper, we conduct a controlled fairness audit examining how LLMs differ in tone, uncertainty, and linguistic framing across demographic identities after access is granted. Using a counterfactual prompt design, we evaluate GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B on career advice tasks while varying identity attributes along age, gender, and nationality. We assess access fairness through refusal analysis and measure interaction quality using automated linguistic metrics, including sentiment, politeness, and hedging. Identity-conditioned differences are evaluated using paired statistical tests. Both models exhibit zero refusal rates across all identities, indicating uniform access. Nevertheless, we observe systematic, model-specific disparities in interaction quality: GPT-4 expresses significantly higher hedging toward younger male users, while LLaMA exhibits broader sentiment variation across identity groups. These results show that fairness disparities can persist at the interaction level even when access is equal, motivating evaluation beyond refusal-based audits.

## 108. HALT: Hallucination Assessment via Log-probs as Time series
- **Authors**: Ahmad Shapiro , Karan Taneja , Ashok Goel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02888](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02888)
- **Abstract**:
> Hallucinations remain a major obstacle for large language models (LLMs), especially in safety-critical domains. We present HALT (Hallucination Assessment via Log-probs as Time series), a lightweight hallucination detector that leverages only the top-20 token log-probabilities from LLM generations as a time series. HALT uses a gated recurrent unit model combined with entropy-based features to learn model calibration bias, providing an extremely efficient alternative to large encoders. Unlike white-box approaches, HALT does not require access to hidden states or attention maps, relying only on output log-probabilities. Unlike black-box approaches, it operates on log-probs rather than surface-form text, which enables stronger domain generalization and compatibility with proprietary LLMs without requiring access to internal weights. To benchmark performance, we introduce HUB (Hallucination detection Unified Benchmark), which consolidates prior datasets into ten capabilities covering both reasoning tasks (Algorithmic, Commonsense, Mathematical, Symbolic, Code Generation) and general purpose skills (Chat, Data-to-Text, Question Answering, Summarization, World Knowledge). While being 30x smaller, HALT outperforms Lettuce, a fine-tuned modernBERT-base encoder, achieving a 60x speedup gain on HUB. HALT and HUB together establish an effective framework for hallucination detection across diverse LLM capabilities.

## 109. Learning-Infused Formal Reasoning: From Contract Synthesis to Artifact Reuse and Formal Semantics
- **Authors**: Arshad Beg , Diarmuid O'Donoghue , Rosemary Monahan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02881](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02881)
- **Abstract**:
> This vision paper articulates a long-term research agenda for formal methods at the intersection with artificial intelligence, outlining multiple conceptual and technical dimensions and reporting on our ongoing work toward realising this agenda. It advances a forward-looking perspective on the next generation of formal methods based on the integration of automated contract synthesis, semantic artifact reuse, and refinement-based theory. We argue that future verification systems must move beyond isolated correctness proofs toward a cumulative, knowledge-driven paradigm in which specifications, contracts, and proofs are continuously synthesised and transferred across systems. To support this shift, we outline a hybrid framework combining large language models with graph-based representations to enable scalable semantic matching and principled reuse of verification artifacts. Learning-based components provide semantic guidance across heterogeneous notations and abstraction levels, while symbolic matching ensures formal soundness. Grounded in compositional reasoning, this vision points toward verification ecosystems that evolve systematically, leveraging past verification efforts to accelerate future assurance.

## 110. Scaling Small Agents Through Strategy Auctions
- **Authors**: Lisa Alazraki , William F. Shen , Yoram Bachrach , Akhil Mathur
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02751)
- **Abstract**:
> Small language models are increasingly viewed as a promising, cost-effective approach to agentic AI, with proponents claiming they are sufficiently capable for agentic workflows. However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents' performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (SALE), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined via a shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training a separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, SALE reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agent's pass@1 with only a negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce cost -- often both -- underscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively "scaled up" through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate a systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspired coordination mechanisms that organize heterogeneous agents into efficient, adaptive ecosystems.

## 111. Entropy-Guided Dynamic Tokens for Graph-LLM Alignment in Molecular Understanding
- **Authors**: Zihao Jing , Qiuhao Zeng , Ruiyi Fang , Yan Sun , Boyu Wang , Pingzhao Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02742](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02742)
- **Abstract**:
> Molecular understanding is central to advancing areas such as scientific discovery, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand molecular graphs effectively. Existing graph-LLM bridges often adapt the Q-Former-style connector with fixed-length static tokens, which is originally designed for vision tasks. These designs overlook stereochemistry and substructural context and typically require costly LLM-backbone fine-tuning, limiting efficiency and generalization. We introduce EDT-Former, an Entropy-guided Dynamic Token Transformer that generates tokens aligned with informative molecular patches, thereby preserving both local and global structural features for molecular graph understanding. Beyond prior approaches, EDT-Former enables alignment between frozen graph encoders and LLMs without tuning the LLM backbone (excluding the embedding layer), resulting in computationally efficient finetuning, and achieves stateof-the-art results on MoleculeQA, Molecule-oriented Mol-Instructions, and property prediction benchmarks (TDC, MoleculeNet), underscoring its effectiveness for scalable and generalizable multimodal molecular understanding

Curiously, we observe that the standard cross-entropy loss -- a core training metric -- often decrease when models encounter systematically corrupted music, undermining its validity as a standalone quality indicator. To investigate this paradox, we introduce noise injection experiment, where controlled noise signal of varying lengths are injected into musical contexts. We hypothesize that a model's loss reacting positively to these perturbations, specifically a sharp increase ("Peak" area) for short injection, can serve as a proxy for its ability to discern musical integrity. Experiments with MusicGen models in the audio waveform domain confirm that Music LLMs respond more strongly to local, texture-level disruptions than to global semantic corruption. Beyond exposing this bias, our results highlight a new principle: the shape of the loss curve -- rather than its absolute value -- encodes critical information about the quality of the generated content (i.e., model behavior). We envision this profile-based evaluation as a label-free, model-intrinsic framework for assessing musical quality -- opening the door to more principled training objectives and sharper benchmarks.

- **Authors**: Rohan Pandey , Haijuan Yan , Hong Yu , Jack Tsai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02731](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02731)
- **Abstract**:
> Homelessness among US veterans remains a critical public health challenge, yet risk prediction offers a pathway for proactive intervention. In this retrospective prognostic study, we analyzed electronic health record (EHR) data from 4,276,403 Veterans Affairs patients during a 2016 observation period to predict first-episode homelessness occurring 3-12 months later in 2017 (prevalence: 0.32-1.19%). We constructed static and time-varying EHR representations, utilizing clinician-informed logic to model the persistence of clinical conditions and social risks over time. We then compared the performance of classical machine learning, transformer-based masked language models, and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that incorporating social and behavioral factors into longitudinal models improved precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) by 15-30%. In the top 1% risk tier, models yielded positive predictive values ranging from 3.93-4.72% at 3 months, 7.39-8.30% at 6 months, 9.84-11.41% at 9 months, and 11.65-13.80% at 12 months across model architectures. Large language models underperformed encoder-based models on discrimination but showed smaller performance disparities across racial groups. These results demonstrate that longitudinal, socially informed EHR modeling concentrates homelessness risk into actionable strata, enabling targeted and data-informed prevention strategies for at-risk veterans.

## 114. BinaryPPO: Efficient Policy Optimization for Binary Classification
- **Authors**: Punya Syon Pandey , Zhijing Jin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02708](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02708)
- **Abstract**:
> Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for binary classification tasks such as toxicity detection, factuality verification, and causal inference. However, SFT often performs poorly in real-world settings with label noise, class imbalance, or sparse supervision. We introduce BinaryPPO, an offline reinforcement learning large language model (LLM) framework that reformulates binary classification as a reward maximization problem. Our method leverages a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a confidence-weighted reward function that penalizes uncertain or incorrect predictions, enabling the model to learn robust decision policies from static datasets without online interaction. Across eight domain-specific benchmarks and multiple models with differing architectures, BinaryPPO improves accuracy by 40-60 percentage points, reaching up to 99%, substantially outperforming supervised baselines. We provide an in-depth analysis of the role of reward shaping, advantage scaling, and policy stability in enabling this improvement. Overall, we demonstrate that confidence-based reward design provides a robust alternative to SFT for binary classification. Our code is available at this https URL .

## 115. Monotonicity as an Architectural Bias for Robust Language Models
- **Authors**: Patrick Cooper , Alireza Nadali , Ashutosh Trivedi , Alvaro Velasquez
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02686](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02686)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit brittle behavior under adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks, even after extensive alignment and fine-tuning. This fragility reflects a broader challenge of modern neural language models: small, carefully structured perturbations in high-dimensional input spaces can induce large and unpredictable changes in internal semantic representations and output. We investigate monotonicity as an architectural inductive bias for improving the robustness of Transformer-based language models. Monotonicity constrains semantic transformations so that strengthening information, evidence, or constraints cannot lead to regressions in the corresponding internal representations. Such order-preserving behavior has long been exploited in control and safety-critical systems to simplify reasoning and improve robustness, but has traditionally been viewed as incompatible with the expressivity required by neural language models. We show that this trade-off is not inherent. By enforcing monotonicity selectively in the feed-forward sublayers of sequence-to-sequence Transformers -- while leaving attention mechanisms unconstrained -- we obtain monotone language models that preserve the performance of their pretrained counterparts. This architectural separation allows negation, contradiction, and contextual interactions to be introduced explicitly through attention, while ensuring that subsequent semantic refinement is order-preserving. Empirically, monotonicity substantially improves robustness: adversarial attack success rates drop from approximately 69% to 19%, while standard summarization performance degrades only marginally.

## 116. Benchmarking Large Language Models for Zero-shot and Few-shot Phishing URL Detection
- **Authors**: Najmul Hasan , Prashanth BusiReddyGari
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02641](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02641)
- **Abstract**:
> The Uniform Resource Locator (URL), introduced in a connectivity-first era to define access and locate resources, remains historically limited, lacking future-proof mechanisms for security, trust, or resilience against fraud and abuse, despite the introduction of reactive protections like HTTPS during the cybersecurity era. In the current AI-first threatscape, deceptive URLs have reached unprecedented sophistication due to the widespread use of generative AI by cybercriminals and the AI-vs-AI arms race to produce context-aware phishing websites and URLs that are virtually indistinguishable to both users and traditional detection tools. Although AI-generated phishing accounted for a small fraction of filter-bypassing attacks in 2024, phishing volume has escalated over 4,000% since 2022, with nearly 50% more attacks evading detection. At the rate the threatscape is escalating, and phishing tactics are emerging faster than labeled data can be produced, zero-shot and few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) offers a timely and adaptable solution, enabling generalization with minimal supervision. Given the critical importance of phishing URL detection in large-scale cybersecurity defense systems, we present a comprehensive benchmark of LLMs under a unified zero-shot and few-shot prompting framework and reveal operational trade-offs. Our evaluation uses a balanced dataset with consistent prompts, offering detailed analysis of performance, generalization, and model efficacy, quantified by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC, to reflect both classification quality and practical utility in threat detection settings. We conclude few-shot prompting improves performance across multiple LLMs.

## 117. Performance of Small Language Model Pretraining on FABRIC: An Empirical Study
- **Authors**: Praveen Rao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02632](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02632)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) require enormous computing power to pretrain on massive datasets. When limited datasets are available, smaller-sized LLMs are better choice to pretrain (on user-specified datasets) by following the scaling laws of LLMs. Using pretrained models, vector embeddings can be generated for raw data and stored using vector databases to support modern AI applications and semantic search. In this work, we investigate the performance of pretraining techniques for smaller-sized LLMs on an experimental testbed (with commodity GPUs) available to academic users at no charge. We consider data parallelism, intra-operator parallelism, and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism, and their combinations for pretraining. We set up different GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous GPU hardware. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of network latency on pretraining performance especially when GPUs are geographically distributed. We used GPT-2 medium and large models and pretrained them using open-source packages, namely, Alpa and Ray. We observed that Alpa's execution plans that collectively optimized intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism consistently performed the best when GPUs were geographically distributed. This was especially true when the network latencies were in 10's of milliseconds. Based on the insights gained from the experiments, we propose a systematic approach for selecting the appropriate pretraining technique to achieve high training performance/lower execution time as well as to reduce the number of GPUs used.

- **Authors**: Roberto Balestri , Pasquale Cascarano , Mirko Degli Esposti , Guglielmo Pescatore
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02630](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02630)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper introduces TRAILDREAMS, a framework that uses a large language model (LLM) to automate the production of movie trailers. The purpose of LLM is to select key visual sequences and impactful dialogues, and to help TRAILDREAMS to generate audio elements such as music and voiceovers. The goal is to produce engaging and visually appealing trailers efficiently. In comparative evaluations, TRAILDREAMS surpasses current state-of-the-art trailer generation methods in viewer ratings. However, it still falls short when compared to real, human-crafted trailers. While TRAILDREAMS demonstrates significant promise and marks an advancement in automated creative processes, further improvements are necessary to bridge the quality gap with traditional trailers.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02619](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02619)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at short-term tasks, scaling them to long-horizon agentic workflows remains challenging. The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon. Beyond benchmark performance, our analysis confirms...

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02613](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02613)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid emergence of autonomous large language model agents has given rise to persistent, large-scale agent ecosystems whose collective behavior cannot be adequately understood through anecdotal observation or small-scale simulation. This paper introduces data-driven silicon sociology as a systematic empirical framework for studying social structure formation among interacting artificial agents. We present a pioneering large-scale data mining investigation of an in-the-wild agent society by analyzing Moltbook, a social platform designed primarily for agent-to-agent interaction. At the time of study, Moltbook hosted over 150,000 registered autonomous agents operating across thousands of agent-created sub-communities. Using programmatic and non-intrusive data acquisition, we collected and analyzed the textual descriptions of 12,758 submolts, which represent proactive sub-community partitioning activities within the ecosystem. Treating agent-authored descriptions as first-class observational artifacts, we apply rigorous preprocessing, contextual embedding, and unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover latent patterns of thematic organization and social space structuring. The results show that autonomous agents systematically organize collective space through reproducible patterns spanning human-mimetic interests, silicon-centric self-reflection, and early-stage economic and coordination behaviors. Rather than relying on predefined sociological taxonomies, these structures emerge directly from machine-generated data traces. This work establishes a methodological foundation for data-driven silicon sociology and demonstrates that data mining techniques can provide a powerful lens for understanding the organization and evolution of large autonomous agent societies.

## 121. Gender Dynamics and Homophily in a Social Network of LLM Agents
- **Authors**: Faezeh Fadaei , Jenny Carla Moran , Taha Yasseri
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02606](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02606)
- **Abstract**:
> Generative artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive settings, yet we know little about how their identity performance develops when they interact within large-scale networks. We address this by examining this http URL , a social media platform similar to X but composed entirely of autonomous AI chatbots. Our dataset comprises over 70,000 agents, approximately 140 million posts, and the evolving followership network over one year. Based on agents' text production, we assign weekly gender scores to each agent. Results suggest that each agent's gender performance is fluid rather than fixed. Despite this fluidity, the network displays strong gender-based homophily, as agents consistently follow others performing gender similarly. Finally, we investigate whether these homophilic connections arise from social selection, in which agents choose to follow similar accounts, or from social influence, in which agents become more similar to their followees over time. Consistent with human social networks, we find evidence that both mechanisms shape the structure and evolution of interactions among LLMs. Our findings suggest that, even in the absence of bodies, cultural entraining of gender performance leads to gender-based sorting. This has important implications for LLM applications in synthetic hybrid populations, social simulations, and decision support.

## 122. Fine-Tuning Language Models to Know What They Know
- **Authors**: Sangjun Park , Elliot Meyerson , Xin Qiu , Risto Miikkulainen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02605](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02605)
- **Abstract**:
> Metacognition is a critical component of intelligence, specifically regarding the awareness of one's own knowledge. While humans rely on shared internal memory for both answering questions and reporting their knowledge state, this dependency in LLMs remains underexplored. This study proposes a framework to measure metacognitive ability $d_{\rm{type2}}'$ using a dual-prompt method, followed by the introduction of Evolution Strategy for Metacognitive Alignment (ESMA) to bind a model's internal knowledge to its explicit behaviors. ESMA demonstrates robust generalization across diverse untrained settings, indicating a enhancement in the model's ability to reference its own knowledge. Furthermore, parameter analysis attributes these improvements to a sparse set of significant modifications.

## 123. AI Assisted Economics Measurement From Survey: Evidence from Public Employee Pension Choice
- **Authors**: Tiancheng Wang , Krishna Sharma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02604](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02604)
- **Abstract**:
> We develop an iterative framework for economic measurement that leverages large language models to extract measurement structure directly from survey instruments. The approach maps survey items to a sparse distribution over latent constructs through what we term a soft mapping, aggregates harmonized responses into respondent level sub dimension scores, and disciplines the resulting taxonomy through out of sample incremental validity tests and discriminant validity diagnostics. The framework explicitly integrates iteration into the measurement construction process. Overlap and redundancy diagnostics trigger targeted taxonomy refinement and constrained remapping, ensuring that added measurement flexibility is retained only when it delivers stable out of sample performance gains. Applied to a large scale public employee retirement plan survey, the framework identifies which semantic components contain behavioral signal and clarifies the economic mechanisms, such as beliefs versus constraints, that matter for retirement choices. The methodology provides a portable measurement audit of survey instruments that can guide both empirical analysis and survey design.

## 124. CaST: Causal Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Graphs in Disaster Tweets
- **Authors**: Hieu Duong , Eugene Levin , Todd Gary , Long Nguyen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02601](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02601)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding causality between real-world events from social media is essential for situational awareness, yet existing causal discovery methods often overlook the interplay between semantic, spatial, and temporal contexts. We propose CaST: Causal Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Graphs, a unified framework for causal discovery in disaster domain that integrates semantic similarity and spatio-temporal proximity using Large Language Models (LLMs) pretrained on disaster datasets. CaST constructs an event graph for each window of tweets. Each event extracted from tweets is represented as a node embedding enriched with its contextual semantics, geographic coordinates, and temporal features. These event nodes are then connected to form a spatio-temporal event graph, which is processed using a multi-head Graph Attention Network (GAT) \cite{gat} to learn directed causal relationships. We construct an in-house dataset of approximately 167K disaster-related tweets collected during Hurricane Harvey and annotated following the MAVEN-ERE schema. Experimental results show that CaST achieves superior performance over both traditional and state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further confirm that incorporating spatial and temporal signals substantially improves both recall and stability during training. Overall, CaST demonstrates that integrating spatio-temporal reasoning into event graphs enables more robust and interpretable causal discovery in disaster-related social media text.

- **Authors**: Eliron Rahimi , Elad Hirshel , Rom Himelstein , Amit LeVi , Avi Mendelson , Chaim Baskin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02600](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02600)
- **Abstract**:
> Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering parallel decoding and controllable sampling dynamics while achieving competitive generation quality at scale. Despite this progress, the role of sampling mechanisms in shaping refusal behavior and jailbreak robustness remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a fundamental analytical framework for step-wise refusal dynamics, enabling comparison between AR and diffusion sampling. Our analysis reveals that the sampling strategy itself plays a central role in safety behavior, as a factor distinct from the underlying learned representations. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal, which supports interpretability and improved safety for both AR and DLMs. We demonstrate that the geometric structure of SRI captures internal recovery dynamics, and identifies anomalous behavior in harmful generations as cases of \emph{incomplete internal recovery} that are not observable at the text level. This structure enables lightweight inference-time detectors that generalize to unseen attacks while matching or outperforming existing defenses with over $100\times$ lower inference overhead.

## 126. RAP: KV-Cache Compression via RoPE-Aligned Pruning
- **Authors**: Jihao Xin , Tian Lvu , Hatem Ltaief , David Keyes , Marco Canini
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02599](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02599)
- **Abstract**:
> Long-context inference in large language models is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory and compute cost of the KV-Cache. Low-rank factorization compresses KV projections by writing $W \approx A * B$, where A produces latent KV states and B can be absorbed into downstream weights. In modern RoPE-based LLMs, this absorption fails: RoPE forces latent KV states to be reconstructed to full dimension, reintroducing substantial memory and compute overhead. We propose RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP), which prunes entire RoPE-aligned column pairs to preserve RoPE's 2x2 rotation structure, restore B absorption, and eliminate reconstruction. Our evaluation on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B shows that RAP enables joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30%, all at once, while maintaining strong accuracy. Notably, RAP reduces attention latency to 83% (prefill) and 77% (decode) of baseline.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02598)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems where collective cooperation is often threatened by the "Tragedy of the Commons." This study investigates the effectiveness of Anchoring Agents--pre-programmed altruistic entities--in fostering cooperation within a Public Goods Game (PGG). Using a full factorial design across three state-of-the-art LLMs, we analyzed both behavioral outcomes and internal reasoning chains. While Anchoring Agents successfully boosted local cooperation rates, cognitive decomposition and transfer tests revealed that this effect was driven by strategic compliance and cognitive offloading rather than genuine norm internalization. Notably, most agents reverted to self-interest in new environments, and advanced models like GPT-4.1 exhibited a "Chameleon Effect," masking strategic defection under public scrutiny. These findings highlight a critical gap between behavioral modification and authentic value alignment in artificial societies.

## 128. ContextEvolve: Multi-Agent Context Compression for Systems Code Optimization
- **Authors**: Hongyuan Su , Yu Zheng , Yong Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02597](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02597)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models are transforming systems research by automating the discovery of performance-critical algorithms for computer systems. Despite plausible codes generated by LLMs, producing solutions that meet the stringent correctness and performance requirements of systems demands iterative optimization. Test-time reinforcement learning offers high search efficiency but requires parameter updates infeasible under API-only access, while existing training-free evolutionary methods suffer from inefficient context utilization and undirected search. We introduce ContextEvolve, a multi-agent framework that achieves RL-level search efficiency under strict parameter-blind constraints by decomposing optimization context into three orthogonal dimensions: a Summarizer Agent condenses semantic state via code-to-language abstraction, a Navigator Agent distills optimization direction from trajectory analysis, and a Sampler Agent curates experience distribution through prioritized exemplar retrieval. This orchestration forms a functional isomorphism with RL-mapping to state representation, policy gradient, and experience replay-enabling principled optimization in a textual latent space. On the ADRS benchmark, ContextEvolve outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 33.3% while reducing token consumption by 29.0%. Codes for our work are released at this https URL

## 129. Constitutional Spec-Driven Development: Enforcing Security by Construction in AI-Assisted Code Generation
- **Authors**: Srinivas Rao Marri
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02584](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02584)
- **Abstract**:
> The proliferation of AI-assisted "vibe coding" enables rapid software development but introduces significant security risks, as Large Language Models (LLMs) prioritize functional correctness over security. We present Constitutional Spec-Driven Development, a methodology that embeds non-negotiable security principles into the specification layer, ensuring AI-generated code adheres to security requirements by construction rather than inspection. Our approach introduces a Constitution: a versioned, machine-readable document encoding security constraints derived from Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)/MITRE Top 25 vulnerabilities and regulatory frameworks. We demonstrate the methodology through a banking microservices application, selected as a representative example domain due to its stringent regulatory and security requirements, implementing customer management, account operations, and transaction processing. The methodology itself is domain-agnostic. The implementation addresses 10 critical CWE vulnerabilities through constitutional constraints with full traceability from principles to code locations. Our case study shows that constitutional constraints reduce security defects by 73% compared to unconstrained AI generation while maintaining developer velocity. We contribute a formal framework for constitutional security, a complete development methodology, and empirical evidence that proactive security specification outperforms reactive security verification in AI-assisted development workflows.

- **Authors**: Nan Zhang , Eugene Kwek , Yusen Zhang , Muyu Pan , Suhang Wang , Prasenjit Mitra , Rui Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02581](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02581)
- **Abstract**:
> Weight-only quantization is important for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by the spirit of classical magnitude pruning, we study whether the magnitude of weight updates during reasoning-incentivized fine-tuning can provide valuable signals for quantizing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We hypothesize that the smallest and largest weight updates during fine-tuning are more important than those of intermediate magnitude, a phenomenon we term "protecting both ends". Upon hypothesis validation, we introduce QuantLRM, which stands for weight quantization of LRMs via fine-tuning signals. We fit simple restricted quadratic functions on weight updates to protect both ends. By multiplying the average quadratic values with the count of zero weight updates of channels, we compute channel importance that is more effective than using activation or second-order information. We run QuantLRM to quantize various fine-tuned models (including supervised, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning) over four reasoning benchmarks (AIME-120, FOLIO, temporal sequences, and GPQA-Diamond) and empirically find that QuantLRM delivers a consistent improvement for LRMs quantization, with an average improvement of 6.55% on a reinforcement learning fine-tuned model. Also supporting non-fine-tuned LRMs, QuantLRM gathers effective signals via pseudo-fine-tuning, which greatly enhances its applicability.

## 131. Reward Shaping for Inference-Time Alignment: A Stackelberg Game Perspective
- **Authors**: Haichuan Wang , Tao Lin , Lingkai Kong , Ce Li , Hezi Jiang , Milind Tambe
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02572](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02572)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing alignment methods directly use the reward model learned from user preference data to optimize an LLM policy, subject to KL regularization with respect to the base policy. This practice is suboptimal for maximizing user's utility because the KL regularization may cause the LLM to inherit the bias in the base policy that conflicts with user preferences. While amplifying rewards for preferred outputs can mitigate this bias, it also increases the risk of reward hacking. This tradeoff motivates the problem of optimally designing reward models under KL regularization. We formalize this reward model optimization problem as a Stackelberg game, and show that a simple reward shaping scheme can effectively approximate the optimal reward model. We empirically evaluate our method in inference-time alignment settings and demonstrate that it integrates seamlessly into existing alignment methods with minimal overhead. Our method consistently improves average reward and achieves win-tie rates exceeding 66% against all baselines, averaged across evaluation settings.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02569](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02569)
- **Abstract**:
> Fact-checking systems with search-enabled large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for verifying claims by dynamically retrieving external evidence. However, the robustness of such systems against adversarial attack remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we study adversarial claim attacks against search-enabled LLM-based fact-checking systems under a realistic input-only threat model. We propose DECEIVE-AFC, an agent-based adversarial attack framework that integrates novel claim-level attack strategies and adversarial claim validity evaluation principles. DECEIVE-AFC systematically explores adversarial attack trajectories that disrupt search behavior, evidence retrieval, and LLM-based reasoning without relying on access to evidence sources or model internals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets and real-world systems demonstrate that our attacks substantially degrade verification performance, reducing accuracy from 78.7% to 53.7%, and significantly outperform existing claim-based attack baselines with strong cross-system transferability.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02561](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02561)
- **Abstract**:
> While the ecosystem of Lean and Mathlib has enjoyed celebrated success in formal mathematical reasoning with the help of large language models (LLMs), the absence of many folklore lemmas in Mathlib remains a persistent barrier that limits Lean's usability as an everyday tool for mathematicians like LaTeX or Maple. To address this, we introduce MathlibLemma, the first LLM-based multi-agent system to automate the discovery and formalization of mathematical folklore lemmas. This framework constitutes our primary contribution, proactively mining the missing connective tissue of mathematics. Its efficacy is demonstrated by the production of a verified library of folklore lemmas, a subset of which has already been formally merged into the latest build of Mathlib, thereby validating the system's real-world utility and alignment with expert standards. Leveraging this pipeline, we further construct the MathlibLemma benchmark, a suite of 4,028 type-checked Lean statements spanning a broad range of mathematical domains. By transforming the role of LLMs from passive consumers to active contributors, this work establishes a constructive methodology for the self-evolution of formal mathematical libraries.

## 134. Beyond Experience Retrieval: Learning to Generate Utility-Optimized Structured Experience for Frozen LLMs
- **Authors**: Xuancheng Li , Haitao Li , Yujia Zhou , Yiqun Liu , Qingyao Ai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02556](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02556)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are largely static and often redo reasoning or repeat mistakes. Prior experience reuse typically relies on external retrieval, which is similarity-based, can introduce noise, and adds latency. We introduce SEAM (Structured Experience Adapter Module), a lightweight, executor-specific plug-in that stores experience in its parameters and generates a structured, instance-tailored experience entry in a single forward pass to guide a frozen LLM executor. SEAM is trained for utility via executor rollouts and GRPO while keeping the executor frozen, and it can be further improved after deployment with supervised fine-tuning on logged successful trajectories. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains across executors with low overhead. Extensive ablations and analyses further elucidate the mechanisms underlying SEAM's effectiveness and robustness.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02555](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02555)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves LLM reasoning, yet growing evidence indicates an exploration ceiling: it often reweights existing solution traces rather than discovering new strategies, limiting gains under large sampling budgets (e.g., pass-at-256). We address this limitation with PSN-RLVR, which perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation to induce temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration that better preserves long-horizon chain-of-thought coherence than action-space noise. To mitigate the resulting sampling-update mismatch, we incorporate truncated importance sampling (TIS). To avoid expensive KL-based adaptive noise control, we propose a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by a lightweight surrogate that combines semantic diversity with normalized self-certainty. Instantiated on GRPO, a widely used RLVR method, PSN-GRPO consistently expands the effective reasoning capability boundary across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods (e.g., Pass-at-k-style training) while remaining orthogonal and thus composable for additional gains.

- **Authors**: Hao Zeng , Huipeng Huang , Xinhao Qu , Jianguo Huang , Bingyi Jing , Hongxin Wei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02550](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02550)
- **Abstract**:
> Data annotation often involves multiple sources with different cost-quality trade-offs, such as fast large language models (LLMs), slow reasoning models, and human experts. In this work, we study the problem of routing inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while controlling the labeling error on test instances. We propose \textbf{HyPAC}, a method that adaptively labels inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while providing distribution-free guarantees on annotation error. HyPAC calibrates two decision thresholds using importance sampling and upper confidence bounds, partitioning inputs into three regions based on uncertainty and routing each to the appropriate annotation source. We prove that HyPAC achieves the minimum expected cost with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on the annotation error, free of data distribution and pre-trained models. Experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, reducing the annotation cost by 78.51\% while tightly controlling the annotation error.

## 137. ToolTok: Tool Tokenization for Efficient and Generalizable GUI Agents
- **Authors**: Xiaoce Wang , Guibin Zhang , Junzhe Li , Jinzhe Tu , Chun Li , Ming Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02548)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing GUI agent models relying on coordinate-based one-step visual grounding struggle with generalizing to varying input resolutions and aspect ratios. Alternatives introduce coordinate-free strategies yet suffer from learning under severe data scarcity. To address the limitations, we propose ToolTok, a novel paradigm of multi-step pathfinding for GUI agents, where operations are modeled as a sequence of progressive tool usage. Specifically, we devise tools aligned with human interaction habits and represent each tool using learnable token embeddings. To enable efficient embedding learning under limited supervision, ToolTok introduces a semantic anchoring mechanism that grounds each tool with semantically related concepts as natural inductive bias. To further enable a pre-trained large language model to progressively acquire tool semantics, we construct an easy-to-hard curriculum consisting of three tasks: token definition question-answering, pure text-guided tool selection, and simplified visual pathfinding. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ToolTok achieves superior performance among models of comparable scale (4B) and remains competitive with a substantially larger model (235B). Notably, these results are obtained using less than 1% of the training data required by other post-training approaches. In addition, ToolTok demonstrates strong generalization across unseen scenarios. Our training & inference code is open-source at this https URL .

## 138. D$^2$Quant: Accurate Low-bit Post-Training Weight Quantization for LLMs
- **Authors**: Xianglong Yan , ChengZhu Bao , Zhiteng Li , Tianao Zhang , Shaoqiu Zhang , Ruobing Xie , Samm Sun , Yulun Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02546)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance, but their high compute and memory costs make deployment difficult in resource-constrained scenarios. Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) is appealing, as it reduces memory usage and enables practical speedup without low-bit operators or specialized hardware. However, accuracy often degrades significantly in weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision, and our analysis identifies two main causes: (1) down-projection matrices are a well-known quantization bottleneck, but maintaining their fidelity often requires extra bit-width; (2) weight quantization induces activation deviations, but effective correction strategies remain underexplored. To address these issues, we propose D$^2$Quant, a novel weight-only PTQ framework that improves quantization from both the weight and activation perspectives. On the weight side, we design a Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ) tailored to down-projection matrices, with an absorbable scaling factor that significantly improves accuracy without increasing the bit budget. On the activation side, we propose Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC), which incorporates a mean-shift correction within LayerNorm to mitigate quantization-induced activation distribution shifts. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics show that D$^2$Quant delivers superior performance for weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision. The code and models will be available at this https URL .

## 139. Beyond Alignment: Expanding Reasoning Capacity via Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization
- **Authors**: Dayu Wang , Jiaye Yang , Weikang Li , Jiahui Liang , Yang Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02545)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, recent studies question whether RL genuinely expands reasoning capacity or merely aligns existing latent capabilities, arguing that exploration remains confined within the pre-trained model's low-rank bias manifold. In this work, we challenge this accessibility boundary hypothesis by demonstrating that the latent reasoning space can be fundamentally expanded through targeted geometric interventions. We propose Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization (MRPO), a geometric framework designed to fundamentally restructure the inference space of LLMs. MRPO operates in two stages: first, we employ Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE) to eject the policy initialization into the null space of the bias manifold; second, we integrate an Effective Rank regularization term into the policy optimization objective. This approach incentivizes the discovery and maintenance of high-dimensional reasoning trajectories against the entropy-reducing tendency of standard RL. Empirically, our 4B-parameter method achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical tasks, significantly outperforming larger models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and expanding the capability boundary beyond standard GRPO.

## 140. SPA-Cache: Singular Proxies for Adaptive Caching in Diffusion Language Models
- **Authors**: Wenhao Sun , Rong-Cheng Tu , Yifu Ding , Zhao Jin , Jingyi Liao , Yongcheng Jing , Dacheng Tao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02544](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02544)
- **Abstract**:
> While Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a flexible, arbitrary-order alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, their non-causal nature precludes standard KV caching, forcing costly hidden state recomputation at every decoding step. Existing DLM caching approaches reduce this cost by selective hidden state updates; however, they are still limited by (i) costly token-wise update identification heuristics and (ii) rigid, uniform budget allocation that fails to account for heterogeneous hidden state dynamics. To address these challenges, we present SPA-Cache that jointly optimizes update identification and budget allocation in DLM cache. First, we derive a low-dimensional singular proxy that enables the identification of update-critical tokens in a low-dimensional subspace, substantially reducing the overhead of update identification. Second, we introduce an adaptive strategy that allocates fewer updates to stable layers without degrading generation quality. Together, these contributions significantly improve the efficiency of DLMs, yielding up to an $8\times$ throughput improvement over vanilla decoding and a $2$--$4\times$ speedup over existing caching baselines.

## 141. Toward Ultra-Long-Horizon Sequential Model Editing
- **Authors**: Mingda Liu , Zhenghan Zhu , Ze'an Miao , Katsuki Fujisawa
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02543)
- **Abstract**:
> Model editing has emerged as a practical approach for mitigating factual errors and outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Among existing methods, the Locate-and-Edit (L&E) paradigm is the dominant framework: it locates MLP parameters implicated in expressing a target fact, and then performs a localized update to rewrite that fact. However, long sequences of edits often trigger abrupt model collapse in L&E beyond a critical point. We empirically identify a strong correlation between collapse and explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms, and formally prove that commonly used L&E update rules can induce exponential norm growth across sequential edits in the absence of explicit norm control. To address this issue, we propose Norm-Anchor Scaling NAS, a plug-and-play norm-constrained strategy. Across extensive experiments, NAS delays the collapse point of representative L&E algorithms by more than 4 times and yields a 72.2% average relative gain in editing performance, requiring only a single additional line of code and incurring negligible computational overhead.

## 143. Scaled Dot-Product Attention implements projection of inputs onto a common surface
- **Authors**: Terence D Sanger
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02521](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02521)
- **Abstract**:
> Scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) is a fundamental component responsible for the success of large-language models and other nonlinear signal processing applications. The rationale for SDPA has been based upon "query, key, value" concepts borrowed from database theory, but these concepts are difficult to reconcile with standard methods in mathematical signal processing. We show that SDPA can be rewritten in a different but mathematically equivalent form as a projection of the input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves. Therefore SDPA discovers nonlinear dependencies in the input that are time-dependent and context-dependent. The rewritten form of SDPA permits increased speed of both feedforward and learning algorithms, but more importantly suggests potential extensions. In the context of language, we re-interpret the role of SDPA as finding a time-dependent contextual meaning determined by the surface on which the set of input vectors lies. Input token embeddings are then modified by the local context surface. This interpretation differs substantially from the concept of "self-attention", and provides a strong justification for the use of SDPA for time-series data with time-varying local nonlinear dependencies.

## 144. Evaluation of Large Language Models' educational feedback in Higher Education: potential, limitations and implications for educational practice
- **Authors**: Daniele Agostini , Federica Picasso
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02519](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02519)
- **Abstract**:
> The importance of managing feedback practices in higher education has been widely recognised, as they play a crucial role in enhancing teaching, learning, and assessment processes. In today's educational landscape, feedback practices are increasingly influenced by technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). Understanding the impact of AI on feedback generation is essential for identifying its potential benefits and establishing effective implementation strategies. This study examines how AI-generated feedback supports student learning using a well-established analytical framework. Specifically, feedback produced by different Large Language Models (LLMs) was assessed in relation to student-designed projects within a training course on inclusive teaching and learning. The evaluation process involved providing seven LLMs with a structured rubric, developed by the university instructor, which defined specific criteria and performance levels. The LLMs were tasked with generating both quantitative assessments and qualitative feedback based on this rubric. The AI-generated feedback was then analysed using Hughes, Smith, and Creese's framework to evaluate its structure and effectiveness in fostering formative learning experiences. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs can generate well-structured feedback and hold great potential as a sustainable and meaningful feedback tool, provided they are guided by clear contextual information and a well-defined instructions that will be explored further in the conclusions.

## 145. GraphDancer: Training LLMs to Explore and Reason over Graphs via Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Yuyang Bai , Zhuofeng Li , Ping Nie , Jianwen Xie , Yu Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02518](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02518)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external knowledge to improve factuality, yet many real-world knowledge sources are organized as heterogeneous graphs rather than plain text. Reasoning over such graph-structured knowledge poses two key challenges: (1) navigating structured, schema-defined relations requires precise function calls rather than similarity-based retrieval, and (2) answering complex questions often demands multi-hop evidence aggregation through iterative information seeking. We propose GraphDancer, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that teaches LLMs to navigate graphs by interleaving reasoning and function execution. To make RL effective for moderate-sized LLMs, we introduce a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by the structural complexity of information-seeking trajectories using an easy-to-hard biased sampler. We evaluate GraphDancer on a multi-domain benchmark by training on one domain only and testing on unseen domains and out-of-distribution question types. Despite using only a 3B backbone, GraphDancer outperforms baselines equipped with either a 14B backbone or GPT-4o-mini, demonstrating robust cross-domain generalization of graph exploration and reasoning skills. Our code and models can be found at this https URL .

## 146. Beyond Translation: Cross-Cultural Meme Transcreation with Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Yuming Zhao , Peiyi Zhang , Oana Ignat
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02510](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02510)
- **Abstract**:
> Memes are a pervasive form of online communication, yet their cultural specificity poses significant challenges for cross-cultural adaptation. We study cross-cultural meme transcreation, a multimodal generation task that aims to preserve communicative intent and humor while adapting culture-specific references. We propose a hybrid transcreation framework based on vision-language models and introduce a large-scale bidirectional dataset of Chinese and US memes. Using both human judgments and automated evaluation, we analyze 6,315 meme pairs and assess transcreation quality across cultural directions. Our results show that current vision-language models can perform cross-cultural meme transcreation to a limited extent, but exhibit clear directional asymmetries: US-Chinese transcreation consistently achieves higher quality than Chinese-US. We further identify which aspects of humor and visual-textual design transfer across cultures and which remain challenging, and propose an evaluation framework for assessing cross-cultural multimodal generation. Our code and dataset are publicly available at this https URL .

## 147. CodeGuard: Improving LLM Guardrails in CS Education
- **Authors**: Nishat Raihan , Noah Erdachew , Jayoti Devi , Joanna C. S. Santos , Marcos Zampieri
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02509)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in Computer Science (CS) classrooms to automate code generation, feedback, and assessment. However, their susceptibility to adversarial or ill-intentioned prompts threatens student learning and academic integrity. To cope with this important issue, we evaluate existing off-the-shelf LLMs in handling unsafe and irrelevant prompts within the domain of CS education. We identify important shortcomings in existing LLM guardrails which motivates us to propose CodeGuard, a comprehensive guardrail framework for educational AI systems. CodeGuard includes (i) a first-of-its-kind taxonomy for classifying prompts; (ii) the CodeGuard dataset, a collection of 8,000 prompts spanning the taxonomy; and (iii) PromptShield, a lightweight sentence-encoder model fine-tuned to detect unsafe prompts in real time. Experiments show that PromptShield achieves 0.93 F1 score, surpassing existing guardrail methods. Additionally, further experimentation reveals that CodeGuard reduces potentially harmful or policy-violating code completions by 30-65% without degrading performance on legitimate educational tasks. The code, datasets, and evaluation scripts are made freely available to the community.

## 148. Test-Time Detoxification without Training or Learning Anything
- **Authors**: Baturay Saglam , Dionysis Kalogerias
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02498](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02498)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models can produce toxic or inappropriate text even for benign inputs, creating risks when deployed at scale. Detoxification is therefore important for safety and user trust, particularly when we want to reduce harmful content without sacrificing the model's generation quality. Many existing approaches rely on model retraining, gradients, or learned auxiliary components, which can be costly and may not transfer across model families or to truly black-box settings. We introduce a test-time procedure that approximates the gradient of completion toxicity with respect to the input embeddings and uses a small number of descent steps to steer generation toward less toxic continuations. This is achieved with zeroth-order optimization that requires only access to input embeddings, a toxicity scoring function, and forward evaluations of the model. Empirically, the approach delivers robust toxicity reductions across models and prompts and, in most settings, achieves the best overall toxicity-quality trade-off. More broadly, our work positions word embeddings as effective control variables and encourages wider use of black-box optimization to guide autoregressive language models toward scalable, safer text generation, without requiring any training or access to intermediate computations.

## 149. STEMVerse: A Dual-Axis Diagnostic Framework for STEM Reasoning in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Xuzhao Li , Xuchen Li , Jian Zhao , Shiyu Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02497](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02497)
- **Abstract**:
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve significant breakthroughs in complex reasoning tasks, evaluating their proficiency in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has become a primary method for measuring machine intelligence. However, current evaluation paradigms often treat benchmarks as isolated "silos," offering only monolithic aggregate scores that neglect the intricacies of both academic specialization and cognitive depth. This result-oriented approach fails to distinguish whether model errors stem from insufficient domain knowledge or deficiencies in cognitive capacity, thereby limiting the diagnostic value. To address this, we propose STEMVerse, a diagnostic framework designed to systematically analyze the STEM reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This framework characterizes model performance across academic specialization and cognitive complexity to map the capability required for reasoning. We re-aggregate over 20,000 STEM problems from mainstream benchmarks into a unified "Discipline $\times$ Cognition" capability space, assigning dual-axis labels to every instance. Utilizing this unified diagnostic framework, we systematically evaluate representative LLM families across varying parameter scales and training paradigms. Our empirical results reveal structural failure patterns in STEM reasoning. By integrating multi-disciplinary coverage and fine-grained cognitive stratification into a unified framework, STEMVerse provides a clear and actionable perspective for understanding the scientific reasoning characteristics of LLMs.

## 150. RLAnything: Forge Environment, Policy, and Reward Model in Completely Dynamic RL System
- **Authors**: Yinjie Wang , Tianbao Xie , Ke Shen , Mengdi Wang , Ling Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02488](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02488)
- **Abstract**:
> We propose RLAnything, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically forges environment, policy, and reward models through closed-loop optimization, amplifying learning signals and strengthening the overall RL system for any LLM or agentic scenarios. Specifically, the policy is trained with integrated feedback from step-wise and outcome signals, while the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback, which in turn further improves policy training. Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively. We also that optimized reward-model signals outperform outcomes that rely on human labels. Code: this https URL
