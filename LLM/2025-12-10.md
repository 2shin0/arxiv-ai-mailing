## 1. Large Causal Models from Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Sridhar Mahadevan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07796](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07796)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce a new paradigm for building large causal models (LCMs) that exploits the enormous potential latent in today's large language models (LLMs). We describe our ongoing experiments with an implemented system called DEMOCRITUS (Decentralized Extraction of Manifold Ontologies of Causal Relations Integrating Topos Universal Slices) aimed at building, organizing, and visualizing LCMs that span disparate domains extracted from carefully targeted textual queries to LLMs. DEMOCRITUS is methodologically distinct from traditional narrow domain and hypothesis centered causal inference that builds causal models from experiments that produce numerical data. A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models. We describe the results of using DEMOCRITUS over a wide range of domains, spanning archaeology, biology, climate change, economics, medicine and technology. We discuss the limitations of the current DEMOCRITUS system, and outline directions for extending its capabilities.

- **Authors**: Nearchos Potamitis , Lars Klein , Akhil Arora

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where reasoning, such as multi-step problem solving and chain-of-thought, is essential. Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding. This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability. Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs. Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability. Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques. ReasonBENCH is publicly available at this https URL .

## 3. RL-MTJail: Reinforcement Learning for Automated Black-Box Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Xiqiao Xiong , Ouxiang Li , Zhuo Liu , Moxin Li , Wentao Shi , Fuli Feng , Xiangnan He
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07761](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07761)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, threatening their safe deployment in real-world applications. This paper studies black-box multi-turn jailbreaks, aiming to train attacker LLMs to elicit harmful content from black-box models through a sequence of prompt-output interactions. Existing approaches typically rely on single turn optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at this https URL . Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful content.

## 4. The Agent Capability Problem: Predicting Solvability Through Information-Theoretic Bounds
- **Authors**: Shahar Lutati
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07631](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07631)
- **Abstract**:
> When should an autonomous agent commit resources to a task? We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints. Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\Ceff = (\Itotal/\Istep), \Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search. We prove that $\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \

## 5. Comparative Analysis and Parametric Tuning of PPO, GRPO, and DAPO for LLM Reasoning Enhancement
- **Authors**: Yongsheng Lian
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07611](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07611)
- **Abstract**:
> This study presents a systematic comparison of three Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and DAPO) for improving complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Our main contribution is a controlled transfer-learning evaluation: models are first fine-tuned on the specialized Countdown Game and then assessed on a suite of general-purpose reasoning benchmarks. Across all tasks, RL-trained models outperform their corresponding base models, although the degree of improvement differs by benchmark. Our parametric analysis offers practical guidance for RL-based LLM training. Increasing the group size in GRPO and DAPO leads to more stable training dynamics and higher accuracy, while the impact of the KL-penalty coefficient is non-monotonic. Additionally, we find that the Dynamic Sampling (DS) component in DAPO does not improve performance; in fact, the best overall results are achieved with DAPO when DS is disabled.

## 6. How Do LLMs Fail In Agentic Scenarios? A Qualitative Analysis of Success and Failure Scenarios of Various LLMs in Agentic Simulations
- **Authors**: JV Roig
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07497](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07497)
- **Abstract**:
> We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when operating as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities. Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data.

## 7. ContextualSHAP : Enhancing SHAP Explanations Through Contextual Language Generation
- **Authors**: Latifa Dwiyanti , Sergio Ryan Wibisono , Hidetaka Nambo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07178](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07178)
- **Abstract**:
> Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an increasingly important area of research, particularly as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes domains. Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations.

## 8. VIGIL: A Reflective Runtime for Self-Healing Agents
- **Authors**: Christopher Cruz
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07094](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07094)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic LLM frameworks promise autonomous behavior via task decomposition, tool use, and iterative planning, but most deployed systems remain brittle. They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime.

## 9. ClinNoteAgents: An LLM Multi-Agent System for Predicting and Interpreting Heart Failure 30-Day Readmission from Clinical Notes
- **Authors**: Rongjia Zhou , Chengzhuo Li , Carl Yang , Jiaying Lu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07081](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07081)
- **Abstract**:
> Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of rehospitalization among older adults in the United States. Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk. By reducing reliance on structured fields and minimizing manual annotation and model training, ClinNoteAgents provides a scalable and interpretable approach to note-based HF readmission risk modeling in data-limited healthcare systems.

## 10. Do Persona-Infused LLMs Affect Performance in a Strategic Reasoning Game?
- **Authors**: John Licato , Stephen Steinle , Brayden Hollis
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06867](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06867)
- **Abstract**:
> Although persona prompting in large language models appears to trigger different styles of generated text, it is unclear whether these translate into measurable behavioral differences, much less whether they affect decision-making in an adversarial strategic environment that we provide as open-source. We investigate the impact of persona prompting on strategic performance in PERIL, a world-domination board game. Specifically, we compare the effectiveness of persona-derived heuristic strategies to those chosen manually. Our findings reveal that certain personas associated with strategic thinking improve game performance, but only when a mediator is used to translate personas into heuristic values. We introduce this mediator as a structured translation process, inspired by exploratory factor analysis, that maps LLM-generated inventory responses into heuristics. Results indicate our method enhances heuristic reliability and face validity compared to directly inferred heuristics, allowing us to better study the effect of persona types on decision making. These insights advance our understanding of how persona prompting influences LLM-based decision-making and propose a heuristic generation method that applies psychometric principles to LLMs.

- **Authors**: Ce Chi , Xing Wang , Zhendong Wang , Xiaofan Liu , Ce Li , Zhiyan Song , Chen Zhao , Kexin Yang , Boshen Shi , Jingjing Yang , Chao Deng , Junlan Feng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06859](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06859)
- **Abstract**:
> In this work, we present JT-DA-8B (JiuTian Data Analyst 8B), a specialized large language model designed for complex table reasoning tasks across diverse real-world scenarios. To address the lack of high-quality supervision in tabular reasoning scenarios, we construct a comprehensive and diverse training corpus with 34 well-defined table reasoning tasks, by aggregating 29 public table QA datasets and 3 million tables. An automatic pipeline is proposed to generate realistic multi-step analytical tasks involving reasoning patterns. The model is trained upon open-source JT-Coder-8B model, an 8B-parameter decoder-only foundation model trained from scratch. In the training stage, we leverage LLM-based scoring and workflow-aligned filtering to distill high-quality, table-centric data. Both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement learning (RL) are adopted to optimize our model. Afterwards, a four-stage table reasoning workflow is proposed, including table preprocessing, table sensing, tool-integrated reasoning, and prompt engineering, to improve model interpretability and execution accuracy. Experimental results show that JT-DA-8B achieves strong performance in various table reasoning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric generation and workflow-driven optimization.

## 12. Decouple to Generalize: Context-First Self-Evolving Learning for Data-Scarce Vision-Language Reasoning
- **Authors**: Tingyu Li , Zheng Sun , Jingxuan Wei , Siyuan Li , Conghui He , Lijun Wu , Cheng Tan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06835](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06835)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL), which provides a feasible solution for realizing continuous self-evolving large vision-language models (LVLMs) in the era of experience. However, RL for VLMs requires abundant high-quality multimodal data, especially challenging in specialized domains like chemistry, earth sciences, and multimodal mathematics. Existing strategies such as synthetic data and self-rewarding mechanisms suffer from limited distributions and alignment difficulties, ultimately causing reward hacking: models exploit high-reward patterns, collapsing policy entropy and destabilizing training. We propose DoGe (Decouple to Generalize), a dual-decoupling framework that guides models to first learn from context rather than problem solving by refocusing on the problem context scenarios overlooked by synthetic data methods. By decoupling learning process into dual components (Thinker and Solver), we reasonably quantify the reward signals of this process and propose a two-stage RL post-training approach from freely exploring context to practically solving tasks. Second, to increase the diversity of training data, DoGe constructs an evolving curriculum learning pipeline: an expanded native domain knowledge corpus and an iteratively evolving seed problems pool. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the baseline across various benchmarks, providing a scalable pathway for realizing self-evolving LVLMs.

## 13. DoVer: Intervention-Driven Auto Debugging for LLM Multi-Agent Systems
- **Authors**: Ming Ma , Jue Zhang , Fangkai Yang , Yu Kang , Qingwei Lin , Saravan Rajmohan , Dongmei Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06749](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06749)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are challenging to debug because failures often arise from long, branching interaction traces. The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step. However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task. To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging. Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses. DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials. These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

## 14. ProAgent: Harnessing On-Demand Sensory Contexts for Proactive LLM Agent Systems
- **Authors**: Bufang Yang , Lilin Xu , Liekang Zeng , Yunqi Guo , Siyang Jiang , Wenrui Lu , Kaiwei Liu , Hancheng Xiang , Xiaofan Jiang , Guoliang Xing , Zhenyu Yan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06721](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06721)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Model (LLM) agents are emerging to transform daily life. However, existing LLM agents primarily follow a reactive paradigm, relying on explicit user instructions to initiate services, which increases both physical and cognitive workload. In this paper, we propose ProAgent, the first end-to-end proactive agent system that harnesses massive sensory contexts and LLM reasoning to deliver proactive assistance. ProAgent first employs a proactive-oriented context extraction approach with on-demand tiered perception to continuously sense the environment and derive hierarchical contexts that incorporate both sensory and persona cues. ProAgent then adopts a context-aware proactive reasoner to map these contexts to user needs and tool calls, providing proactive assistance. We implement ProAgent on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses with an edge server and extensively evaluate it on a real-world testbed, a public dataset, and through a user study. Results show that ProAgent achieves up to 33.4% higher proactive prediction accuracy, 16.8% higher tool-calling F1 score, and notable improvements in user satisfaction over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a significant step toward proactive assistants. A video demonstration of ProAgent is available at this https URL .

## 15. Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA): A Lifecycle Supervision Framework for Robustly Aligned AI Agents
- **Authors**: Zhibo Liang , Tianze Hu , Zaiye Chen , Mingjie Tang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06716](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06716)
- **Abstract**:
> Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit significant vulnerability to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated "Intent Graph"; and (ii) an innovative "Tiered Adjudicator" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.

## 16. Stochasticity in Agentic Evaluations: Quantifying Inconsistency with Intraclass Correlation
- **Authors**: Zairah Mustahsan , Abel Lim , Megna Anand , Saahil Jain , Bryan McCann
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06710](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06710)
- **Abstract**:
> As large language models become components of larger agentic systems, evaluation reliability becomes critical: unreliable sub-agents introduce brittleness into downstream system behavior. Yet current evaluation practice, reporting a single accuracy number from a single run, obscures the variance underlying these results, making it impossible to distinguish genuine capability improvements from lucky sampling. We propose adopting Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), a metric from measurement science, to characterize this variance. ICC decomposes observed variance into between-query variance (task difficulty) and within-query variance (agent inconsistency), highlighting whether reported results reflect true capability or measurement noise. We evaluated on GAIA (Levels 1-3, measuring agentic capabilities across varying reasoning complexity) and FRAMES (measuring retrieval and factuality across multiple documents). We found that ICC varies dramatically with task structure, with reasoning and retrieval tasks (FRAMES) exhibit ICC=0.4955-0.7118 across models, and agentic tasks (GAIA) exhibiting ICC=0.304-0.774 across models. For sub-agent replacement decisions in agentic systems, accuracy improvements are only trustworthy if ICC also improves. We demonstrate that ICC converges by n=8-16 trials for structured tasks and n>=32 for complex reasoning, enabling practitioners to set evidence-based resampling budgets. We recommend reporting accuracy alongside ICC and within-query variance as standard practice, and propose updated Evaluation Cards capturing these metrics. By making evaluation stability visible, we aim to transform agentic benchmarking from opaque leaderboard competition to trustworthy experimental science. Our code is open-sourced at this https URL .

## 17. The Effect of Belief Boxes and Open-mindedness on Persuasion
- **Authors**: Onur Bilgin , Abdullah As Sami , Sriram Sai Vujjini , John Licato
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06573](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06573)
- **Abstract**:
> As multi-agent systems are increasingly utilized for reasoning and decision-making applications, there is a greater need for LLM-based agents to have something resembling propositional beliefs. One simple method for doing so is to include statements describing beliefs maintained in the prompt space (in what we'll call their belief boxes). But when agents have such statements in belief boxes, how does it actually affect their behaviors and dispositions towards those beliefs? And does it significantly affect agents' ability to be persuasive in multi-agent scenarios? Likewise, if the agents are given instructions to be open-minded, how does that affect their behaviors? We explore these and related questions in a series of experiments. Our findings confirm that instructing agents to be open-minded affects how amenable they are to belief change. We show that incorporating belief statements and their strengths influences an agent's resistance to (and persuasiveness against) opposing viewpoints. Furthermore, it affects the likelihood of belief change, particularly when the agent is outnumbered in a debate by opposing viewpoints, i.e., peer pressure scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the belief box technique in reasoning and decision-making tasks.

## 18. UncertaintyZoo: A Unified Toolkit for Quantifying Predictive Uncertainty in Deep Learning Systems
- **Authors**: Xianzong Wu , Xiaohong Li , Lili Quan , Qiang Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06406](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06406)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models(LLMs) are increasingly expanding their real-world applications across domains, e.g., question answering, autonomous driving, and automatic software development. Despite this achievement, LLMs, as data-driven systems, often make incorrect predictions, which can lead to potential losses in safety-critical scenarios. To address this issue and measure the confidence of model outputs, multiple uncertainty quantification(UQ) criteria have been proposed. However, even though important, there are limited tools to integrate these methods, hindering the practical usage of UQ methods and future research in this domain. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce UncertaintyZoo, a unified toolkit that integrates 29 uncertainty quantification methods, covering five major categories under a standardized interface. Using UncertaintyZoo, we evaluate the usefulness of existing uncertainty quantification methods under the code vulnerability detection task on CodeBERT and ChatGLM3 models. The results demonstrate that UncertaintyZoo effectively reveals prediction uncertainty. The tool with a demonstration video is available on the project site this https URL .

## 19. GENIUS: An Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Design and Execution of Simulation Protocols
- **Authors**: Mohammad Soleymanibrojeni , Roland Aydin , Diego Guedes-Sobrinho , Alexandre C. Dias , Maurício J. Piotrowski , Wolfgang Wenzel , Celso Ricardo Caldeira Rêgo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06404](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06404)
- **Abstract**:
> Predictive atomistic simulations have propelled materials discovery, yet routine setup and debugging still demand computer specialists. This know-how gap limits Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), where state-of-the-art codes exist but remain cumbersome for non-experts. We address this bottleneck with GENIUS, an AI-agentic workflow that fuses a smart Quantum ESPRESSO knowledge graph with a tiered hierarchy of large language models supervised by a finite-state error-recovery machine. Here we show that GENIUS translates free-form human-generated prompts into validated input files that run to completion on $\approx$80% of 295 diverse benchmarks, where 76% are autonomously repaired, with success decaying exponentially to a 7% baseline. Compared with LLM-only baselines, GENIUS halves inference costs and virtually eliminates hallucinations. The framework democratizes electronic-structure DFT simulations by intelligently automating protocol generation, validation, and repair, opening large-scale screening and accelerating ICME design loops across academia and industry worldwide.

## 20. Less Is More for Multi-Step Logical Reasoning of LLM Generalisation Under Rule Removal, Paraphrasing, and Compression
- **Authors**: Qiming Bao , Xiaoxuan Fu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06393](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06393)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) excel across many natural language tasks, yet their generalisation to structural perturbations in logical contexts remains poorly understood. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework that probes reasoning reliability through four targeted stress tests: (1) rule deletion, removing either redundant or essential rules from a multi-step inference chain; (2) contradictory evidence injection; (3) logic-preserving rewrites generated through several families of equivalence laws (contrapositive, double negation, implication, De Morgan, identity, and commutativity); and (4) multi-law equivalence stacking that introduces 2-5 simultaneous logical transformations. Across three representative model families: BERT, Qwen2, and LLaMA-like models. Our experiments reveal a strikingly consistent pattern: all models achieve perfect accuracy on the base tasks and remain fully generalise to redundant rule deletion and all equivalence-based rewrites (single or multi-law), but fail sharply under essential rule deletion (dropping to 25% accuracy) and collapse completely in the presence of explicit contradictions (0% accuracy). These results demonstrate that LLMs possess stable invariance to semantic-preserving logical transformations, yet remain fundamentally brittle to missing or conflicting evidence. Our framework provides a clean diagnostic tool for isolating such reasoning failure modes and highlights persistent gaps in the logical generalisation abilities of current LLMs.

## 21. DaGRPO: Rectifying Gradient Conflict in Reasoning via Distinctiveness-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization
- **Authors**: Xuan Xie , Xuan Wang , Wenjie Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06337](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06337)
- **Abstract**:
> The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift from superficial instruction following to rigorous long-horizon reasoning. While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for eliciting such post-training reasoning capabilities due to its exceptional performance, it remains plagued by significant training instability and poor sample efficiency. We theoretically identify the root cause of these issues as the lack of distinctiveness within on-policy rollouts: for routine queries, highly homogeneous samples induce destructive gradient conflicts; whereas for hard queries, the scarcity of valid positive samples results in ineffective optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose Distinctiveness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (DaGRPO). DaGRPO incorporates two core mechanisms: (1) Sequence-level Gradient Rectification, which utilizes fine-grained scoring to dynamically mask sample pairs with low distinctiveness, thereby eradicating gradient conflicts at the source; and (2) Off-policy Data Augmentation, which introduces high-quality anchors to recover training signals for challenging tasks. Extensive experiments across 9 mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization benchmarks demonstrate that DaGRPO significantly surpasses existing SFT, GRPO, and hybrid baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art performance (e.g., a +4.7% average accuracy gain on math benchmarks). Furthermore, in-depth analysis confirms that DaGRPO effectively mitigates gradient explosion and accelerates the emergence of long-chain reasoning capabilities.

## 22. On measuring grounding and generalizing grounding problems
- **Authors**: Daniel Quigley , Eric Maynard
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06205](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06205)
- **Abstract**:
> The symbol grounding problem asks how tokens like cat can be about cats, as opposed to mere shapes manipulated in a calculus. We recast grounding from a binary judgment into an audit across desiderata, each indexed by an evaluation tuple (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution): authenticity (mechanisms reside inside the agent and, for strong claims, were acquired through learning or evolution); preservation (atomic meanings remain intact); faithfulness, both correlational (realized meanings match intended ones) and etiological (internal mechanisms causally contribute to success); robustness (graceful degradation under declared perturbations); compositionality (the whole is built systematically from the parts). We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition. By operationalizing a philosophical inquiry about representation, we equip philosophers of science, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians with a common language and technical framework for systematic investigation of grounding and meaning.

## 23. ARCANE: A Multi-Agent Framework for Interpretable and Configurable Alignment
- **Authors**: Charlie Masters , Marta Grześkiewicz , Stefano V. Albrecht
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06196](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06196)
- **Abstract**:
> As agents based on large language models are increasingly deployed to long-horizon tasks, maintaining their alignment with stakeholder preferences becomes critical. Effective alignment in such settings requires reward models that are interpretable so that stakeholders can understand and audit model objectives. Moreover, reward models must be capable of steering agents at interaction time, allowing preference shifts to be incorporated without retraining. We introduce ARCANE, a framework that frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration problem that dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics: weighted sets of verifiable criteria that can be generated on-the-fly from task context. Inspired by utility theory, we formulate rubric learning as a reconstruction problem and apply a regularized Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) procedure that balances interpretability, faithfulness, and computational efficiency. Using a corpus of 219 labeled rubrics derived from the GDPVal benchmark, we evaluate ARCANE on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use. The learned rubrics produce compact, legible evaluations and enable configurable trade-offs (e.g., correctness vs. conciseness) without retraining. Our results show that rubric-based reward models offer a promising path toward interpretable, test-time adaptive alignment for complex, long-horizon AI systems.

## 24. Deep learning for autism detection using clinical notes: A comparison of transfer learning for a transparent and black-box approach
- **Authors**: Gondy Leroy , Prakash Bisht , Sai Madhuri Kandula , Nell Maltman , Sydney Rice
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06161](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06161)
- **Abstract**:
> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition whose rising prevalence places increasing demands on a lengthy diagnostic process. Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating ASD diagnosis, but most existing models operate as black boxes and are typically trained on a single dataset, limiting their generalizability. In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach. Mixing datasets during training resulted in slightly better performance and should be the preferred approach when practically possible. This work paves the way for more trustworthy, generalizable, and clinically actionable AI tools in neurodevelopmental diagnostics.

## 25. Going All-In on LLM Accuracy: Fake Prediction Markets, Real Confidence Signals
- **Authors**: Michael Todasco (Visiting Fellow at the James Silberrad Center for Artificial Intelligence, San Diego State University)
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05998](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05998)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models are increasingly used to evaluate other models, yet these judgments typically lack any representation of confidence. This pilot study tests whether framing an evaluation task as a betting game (a fictional prediction market with its own LLM currency) improves forecasting accuracy and surfaces calibrated confidence signals. We generated 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline models (three current-generation, three prior-generation) answered all items. Three Predictor models then forecasted, for each question-baseline pair, if the baseline would answer correctly. Each predictor completed matched runs in two conditions: Control (simple correct/incorrect predictions) and Incentive (predictions plus wagers of 1-100,000 LLMCoin under even odds, starting from a 1,000,000 LLMCoin bankroll). Across 5,400 predictions per condition, Incentive runs showed modestly higher accuracy (81.5% vs. 79.1%, p = .089, d = 0.86) and significantly faster learning across rounds (12.0 vs. 2.9 percentage-point improvement from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011). Most notably, stake size tracked confidence. "Whale" bets of 40,000+ coins were correct ~99% of the time, while small bets (<1,000 coins) showed only ~74% accuracy. The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot. Rather, the betting mechanic created a legible confidence signal absent from binary yes/no outputs. This suggests that simple financial framing may help transform LLMs into risk-aware forecasters, making their internal beliefs visible and usable. The protocol offers a foundation for future work for meta-evaluation systems and what may become LLM-to-LLM prediction markets.

## 26. Relational Visual Similarity

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07833](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07833)
- **Abstract**:
> Humans do not just see attribute similarity -- we also see relational similarity. An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing.

## 27. Provable Long-Range Benefits of Next-Token Prediction
- **Authors**: Xinyuan Cao , Santosh S. Vempala
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07818](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07818)
- **Abstract**:
> Why do modern language models, trained to do well on next-word prediction, appear to generate coherent documents and capture long-range structure? Here we show that next-token prediction is provably powerful for learning longer-range structure, even with common neural network architectures. Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice.

## 28. Understanding Privacy Risks in Code Models Through Training Dynamics: A Causal Approach
- **Authors**: Hua Yang (1), Alejandro Velasco (2), Sen Fang (1), Bowen Xu (1), Denys Poshyvanyk (2) ((1) North Carolina State University, (2) William &amp; Mary)
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07814](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07814)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models for code (LLM4Code) have greatly improved developer productivity but also raise privacy concerns due to their reliance on open-source repositories containing abundant personally identifiable information (PII). Prior work shows that commercial models can reproduce sensitive PII, yet existing studies largely treat PII as a single category and overlook the heterogeneous risks among different types. We investigate whether distinct PII types vary in their likelihood of being learned and leaked by LLM4Code, and whether this relationship is causal. Our methodology includes building a dataset with diverse PII types, fine-tuning representative models of different scales, computing training dynamics on real PII data, and formulating a structural causal model to estimate the causal effect of learnability on leakage. Results show that leakage risks differ substantially across PII types and correlate with their training dynamics: easy-to-learn instances such as IP addresses exhibit higher leakage, while harder types such as keys and passwords leak less frequently. Ambiguous types show mixed behaviors. This work provides the first causal evidence that leakage risks are type-dependent and offers guidance for developing type-aware and learnability-aware defenses for LLM4Code.

## 29. Collaborative Causal Sensemaking: Closing the Complementarity Gap in Human-AI Decision Support
- **Authors**: Raunak Jain , Mudita Khurana
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07801](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07801)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for expert decision support, yet human-AI teams in high-stakes settings do not yet reliably outperform the best individual. We argue this complementarity gap reflects a fundamental mismatch: current agents are trained as answer engines, not as partners in the collaborative sensemaking through which experts actually make decisions. Sensemaking (the ability to co-construct causal explanations, surface uncertainties, and adapt goals) is the key capability that current training pipelines do not explicitly develop or evaluate. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda to develop this capability from the ground up, spanning new training environments that reward collaborative thinking, representations for shared human-AI mental models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. These directions can advance MAS research toward agents that think with their human partners rather than for them.

## 30. SAVE: Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement for Mitigating Object Hallucination
- **Authors**: Sangha Park , Seungryong Yoo , Jisoo Mok , Sungroh Yoon
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07730](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07730)
- **Abstract**:
> Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced substantially, they remain vulnerable to object hallucination caused by language priors and visual information loss. To address this, we propose SAVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement), a framework that mitigates hallucination by steering the model along Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latent features. A binary object-presence question-answering probe identifies the SAE features most indicative of the model's visual information processing, referred to as visual understanding features. Steering the model along these identified features reinforces grounded visual understanding and effectively reduces hallucination. With its simple design, SAVE outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods on standard benchmarks, achieving a 10\%p improvement in CHAIR\_S and consistent gains on POPE and MMHal-Bench. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and layers confirm the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering along visual understanding features suppresses the generation of uncertain object tokens and increases attention to image tokens, mitigating hallucination.

## 31. In-Context and Few-Shots Learning for Forecasting Time Series Data based on Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Saroj Gopali , Bipin Chhetri , Deepika Giri , Sima Siami-Namini , Akbar Siami Namin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07705](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07705)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing data-driven approaches in modeling and predicting time series data include ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), Transformer-based models, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network). These approaches, and in particular deep learning-based models such as LSTM and TCN, have shown great results in predicting time series data. With the advancement of leveraging pre-trained foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and more notably Google's recent foundation model for time series data, {\it TimesFM} (Time Series Foundation Model), it is of interest to investigate whether these foundation models have the capability of outperforming existing modeling approaches in analyzing and predicting time series data. This paper investigates the performance of using LLM models for time series data prediction. We investigate the in-context learning methodology in the training of LLM models that are specific to the underlying application domain. More specifically, the paper explores training LLMs through in-context, zero-shot and few-shot learning and forecasting time series data with OpenAI {\tt o4-mini} and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, as well as the recent Google's Transformer-based TimesFM, a time series-specific foundation model, along with two deep learning models, namely TCN and LSTM networks. The findings indicate that TimesFM has the best overall performance with the lowest RMSE value (0.3023) and the competitive inference time (266 seconds). Furthermore, OpenAI's o4-mini also exhibits a good performance based on Zero Shot learning. These findings highlight pre-trained time series foundation models as a promising direction for real-time forecasting, enabling accurate and scalable deployment with minimal model adaptation.

## 32. When Large Language Models Do Not Work: Online Incivility Prediction through Graph Neural Networks
- **Authors**: Zihan Chen , Lanyu Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07684](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07684)
- **Abstract**:
> Online incivility has emerged as a widespread and persistent problem in digital communities, imposing substantial social and psychological burdens on users. Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction. All datasets and comparative outputs will be publicly available in our repository to support further research and reproducibility.

## 33. An AI-Powered Autonomous Underwater System for Sea Exploration and Scientific Research
- **Authors**: Hamad Almazrouei , Mariam Al Nasseri , Maha Alzaabi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07652](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07652)
- **Abstract**:
> Traditional sea exploration faces significant challenges due to extreme conditions, limited visibility, and high costs, resulting in vast unexplored ocean regions. This paper presents an innovative AI-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system designed to overcome these limitations by automating underwater object detection, analysis, and reporting. The system integrates YOLOv12 Nano for real-time object detection, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (ResNet50) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means++ clustering for grouping marine objects based on visual characteristics. Furthermore, a Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4o Mini) is employed to generate structured reports and summaries of underwater findings, enhancing data interpretation. The system was trained and evaluated on a combined dataset of over 55,000 images from the DeepFish and OzFish datasets, capturing diverse Australian marine environments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to detect marine objects with a mAP@0.5 of 0.512, a precision of 0.535, and a recall of 0.438. The integration of PCA effectively reduced feature dimensionality while preserving 98% variance, facilitating K-Means clustering which successfully grouped detected objects based on visual similarities. The LLM integration proved effective in generating insightful summaries of detections and clusters, supported by location data. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risks associated with human diving, increases mission efficiency, and enhances the speed and depth of underwater data analysis, paving the way for more effective scientific research and discovery in challenging marine environments.

- **Abstract**:
> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has resulted in a significant knowledge gap between the open-source community and industry, primarily because the latter relies on closed-source, high-quality data and training recipes. To address this, we introduce PCMind-2.1-Kaiyuan-2B, a fully open-source 2-billion-parameter model focused on improving training efficiency and effectiveness under resource constraints. Our methodology includes three key innovations: a Quantile Data Benchmarking method for systematically comparing heterogeneous open-source datasets and providing insights on data mixing strategies; a Strategic Selective Repetition scheme within a multi-phase paradigm to effectively leverage sparse, high-quality data; and a Multi-Domain Curriculum Training policy that orders samples by quality. Supported by a highly optimized data preprocessing pipeline and architectural modifications for FP16 stability, Kaiyuan-2B achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art fully open-source models, demonstrating practical and scalable solutions for resource-limited pretraining. We release all assets (including model weights, data, and code) under Apache 2.0 license at this https URL .

## 35. Metric-Fair Prompting: Treating Similar Samples Similarly
- **Authors**: Jing Wang , Jie Shen , Xing Niu , Tong Zhang , Jeremy Weiss
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07608](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07608)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce \emph{Metric-Fair Prompting}, a fairness-aware prompting framework that guides large language models (LLMs) to make decisions under metric-fairness constraints. In the application of multiple-choice medical question answering, each {(question, option)} pair is treated as a binary instance with label $+1$ (correct) or $-1$ (incorrect). To promote {individual fairness}~--~treating similar instances similarly~--~we compute question similarity using NLP embeddings and solve items in \emph{joint pairs of similar questions} rather than in isolation. The prompt enforces a global decision protocol: extract decisive clinical features, map each \((\text{question}, \text{option})\) to a score $f(x)$ that acts as confidence, and impose a Lipschitz-style constraint so that similar inputs receive similar scores and, hence, consistent outputs. Evaluated on the {MedQA (US)} benchmark, Metric-Fair Prompting is shown to improve performance over standard single-item prompting, demonstrating that fairness-guided, confidence-oriented reasoning can enhance LLM accuracy on high-stakes clinical multiple-choice questions.

## 36. Complementary Learning Approach for Text Classification using Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Navid Asgari , Benjamin M. Cole
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07583](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07583)
- **Abstract**:
> In this study, we propose a structured methodology that utilizes large language models (LLMs) in a cost-efficient and parsimonious manner, integrating the strengths of scholars and machines while offsetting their respective weaknesses. Our methodology, facilitated through a chain of thought and few-shot learning prompting from computer science, extends best practices for co-author teams in qualitative research to human-machine teams in quantitative research. This allows humans to utilize abductive reasoning and natural language to interrogate not just what the machine has done but also what the human has done. Our method highlights how scholars can manage inherent weaknesses OF LLMs using careful, low-cost techniques. We demonstrate how to use the methodology to interrogate human-machine rating discrepancies for a sample of 1,934 press releases announcing pharmaceutical alliances (1990-2017).

## 37. Toward More Reliable Artificial Intelligence: Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Kassoum Sanogo , Renzo Ardiccioni
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07564](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07564)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content plausible but incorrect claims about image content. We propose a training-free self-correction framework enabling VLMs to iteratively refine responses through uncertainty-guided visual re-attention. Our method combines multidimensional uncertainty quantification (token entropy, attention dispersion, semantic consistency, claim confidence) with attention-guided cropping of under-explored regions. Operating entirely with frozen, pretrained VLMs, our framework requires no gradient updates. We validate our approach on the POPE and MMHAL BENCH benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23] architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that uncertainty-guided re-attention successfully grounds corrections in visual evidence where standard decoding fails. We validate our approach on Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23], with plans to extend validation across diverse architectures in future versions. We release our code and methodology to facilitate future research in trustworthy multimodal systems.

## 38. MoCoRP: Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response for Persona-based Dialogue
- **Authors**: Kyungro Lee , Dongha Choi , Hyunju Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07544](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07544)
- **Abstract**:
> As dialogue systems become increasingly important across various domains, a key challenge in persona-based dialogue is generating engaging and context-specific interactions while ensuring the model acts with a coherent personality. However, existing persona-based dialogue datasets lack explicit relations between persona sentences and responses, which makes it difficult for models to effectively capture persona information. To address these issues, we propose MoCoRP (Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response), a framework that incorporates explicit relations into language models. MoCoRP leverages an NLI expert to explicitly extract the NLI relations between persona sentences and responses, enabling the model to effectively incorporate appropriate persona information from the context into its responses. We applied this framework to pre-trained models like BART and further extended it to modern large language models (LLMs) through alignment tuning. Experimental results on the public datasets ConvAI2 and MPChat demonstrate that MoCoRP outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior persona consistency and engaging, context-aware dialogue generation. Furthermore, our model not only excels in quantitative metrics but also shows significant improvements in qualitative aspects. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling persona-response relations in persona-based dialogue. The source codes of MoCoRP are available at this https URL .

## 39. VulnLLM-R: Specialized Reasoning LLM with Agent Scaffold for Vulnerability Detection
- **Authors**: Yuzhou Nie , Hongwei Li , Chengquan Guo , Ruizhe Jiang , Zhun Wang , Bo Li , Dawn Song , Wenbo Guo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07533](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07533)
- **Abstract**:
> We propose VulnLLM-R, the~\emph{first specialized reasoning LLM} for vulnerability detection. Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models. The code is available at~\href{ this https URL }{github}.

## 40. LIME: Making LLM Data More Efficient with Linguistic Metadata Embeddings
- **Authors**: Sebastian Sztwiertnia , Felix Friedrich , Kristian Kersting , Patrick Schramowski , Björn Deiseroth
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07522](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07522)
- **Abstract**:
> Pre-training decoder-only language models relies on vast amounts of high-quality data, yet the availability of such data is increasingly reaching its limits. While metadata is commonly used to create and curate these datasets, its potential as a direct training signal remains under-explored. We challenge this status quo and propose LIME (Linguistic Metadata Embeddings), a method that enriches token embeddings with metadata capturing syntax, semantics, and contextual properties. LIME substantially improves pre-training efficiency. Specifically, it adapts up to 56% faster to the training data distribution, while introducing only 0.01% additional parameters at negligible compute overhead. Beyond efficiency, LIME improves tokenization, leading to remarkably stronger language modeling capabilities and generative task performance. These benefits persist across model scales (500M to 2B). In addition, we develop a variant with shifted metadata, LIME+1, that can guide token generation. Given prior metadata for the next token, LIME+1 improves reasoning performance by up to 38% and arithmetic accuracy by up to 35%.

## 41. AutoICE: Automatically Synthesizing Verifiable C Code via LLM-driven Evolution
- **Authors**: Weilin Luo , Xueyi Liang , Haotian Deng , Yanan Liu , Hai Wan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07501](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07501)
- **Abstract**:
> Automatically synthesizing verifiable code from natural language requirements ensures software correctness and reliability while significantly lowering the barrier to adopting the techniques of formal methods. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), long-standing efforts at autoformalization have gained new momentum. However, existing approaches suffer from severe syntactic and semantic errors due to the scarcity of domain-specific pre-training corpora and often fail to formalize implicit knowledge effectively. In this paper, we propose AutoICE, an LLM-driven evolutionary search for synthesizing verifiable C code. It introduces the diverse individual initialization and the collaborative crossover to enable diverse iterative updates, thereby mitigating error propagation inherent in single-agent iterations. Besides, it employs the self-reflective mutation to facilitate the discovery of implicit knowledge. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoICE: it successfully verifies $90.36$\% of code, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. Besides, on a developer-friendly dataset variant, AutoICE achieves a $88.33$\% verification success rate, significantly surpassing the $65$\% success rate of the SOTA approach.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07462](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07462)
- **Abstract**:
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07454](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07454)
- **Abstract**:
> The democratization of AI is currently hindered by the immense computational costs required to train Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource languages. This paper presents Persian-Phi, a 3.8B parameter model that challenges the assumption that robust multilingual capabilities require massive model sizes or multilingual baselines. We demonstrate how Microsoft Phi-3 Mini -- originally a monolingual English model -- can be effectively adapted to Persian through a novel, resource-efficient curriculum learning pipeline. Our approach employs a unique "warm-up" stage using bilingual narratives (Tiny Stories) to align embeddings prior to heavy training, followed by continual pretraining and instruction tuning via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). Despite its compact size, Persian-Phi achieves competitive results on Open Persian LLM Leaderboard in HuggingFace. Our findings provide a validated, scalable framework for extending the reach of state-of-the-art LLMs to underrepresented languages with minimal hardware resources. The Persian-Phi model is publicly available at this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07404](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07404)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for code generation, they often output incorrect code. One reason is that model output probabilities are often not well-correlated with correctness, and reflect only the final output of the generation process. Inspired by findings that LLMs internally encode concepts like truthfulness, this paper explores if LLMs similarly represent code correctness. Specifically, we identify a correctness representation inside LLMs by contrasting the hidden states between pairs of correct and incorrect code for the same programming tasks. By experimenting on four LLMs, we show that exploiting this extracted correctness representation outperforms standard log-likelihood ranking, as well as verbalized model confidence. Furthermore, we explore how this internal correctness signal can be used to select higher-quality code samples, without requiring test execution. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how leveraging internal representations can enhance code generation systems and make LLMs more reliable, thus improving confidence in automatically generated code.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07371](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07371)
- **Abstract**:
> Behavior-cloning based visuomotor policies enable precise manipulation but often inherit the slow, cautious tempo of human demonstrations, limiting practical deployment. However, prior studies on acceleration methods mainly rely on statistical or heuristic cues that ignore task semantics and can fail across diverse manipulation settings. We present ESPADA, a semantic and spatially aware framework that segments demonstrations using a VLM-LLM pipeline with 3D gripper-object relations, enabling aggressive downsampling only in non-critical segments while preserving precision-critical phases, without requiring extra data or architectural modifications, or any form of retraining. To scale from a single annotated episode to the full dataset, ESPADA propagates segment labels via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) on dynamics-only features. Across both simulation and real-world experiments with ACT and DP baselines, ESPADA achieves approximately a 2x speed-up while maintaining success rates, narrowing the gap between human demonstrations and efficient robot control.

## 46. Structure-Aware Feature Rectification with Region Adjacency Graphs for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation
- **Authors**: Qiming Huang , Hao Ai , Jianbo Jiao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07360](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07360)
- **Abstract**:
> Benefiting from the inductive biases learned from large-scale datasets, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) leverages the power of vision-language models, such as CLIP, to achieve remarkable progress without requiring task-specific training. However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively suppresses segmentation noise, improves region-level consistency, and achieves strong performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

- **Authors**: Shengyuan Ye , Bei Ouyang , Tianyi Qian , Liekang Zeng , Mu Yuan , Xiaowen Chu , Weijie Hong , Xu Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07344](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07344)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal comprehension capabilities and are being deployed in an increasing number of online video understanding applications. While recent efforts extensively explore advancing VLMs' reasoning power in these cases, deployment constraints are overlooked, leading to overwhelming system overhead in real-world deployments. To address that, we propose Venus, an on-device memory-and-retrieval system for efficient online video understanding. Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy.

- **Authors**: Zhongchun Zhou , Chengtao Lai , Yuhang Gu , Wei Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07312](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07312)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) is pushing AI accelerators toward increasingly powerful and specialized designs. Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing. We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups. Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency. Our findings explore the potential of the shared cache design to assist the development of future AI accelerator systems.

## 49. Radiance-Field Reinforced Pretraining: Scaling Localization Models with Unlabeled Wireless Signals
- **Authors**: Guosheng Wang , Shen Wang , Lei Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07309)
- **Abstract**:
> Radio frequency (RF)-based indoor localization offers significant promise for applications such as indoor navigation, augmented reality, and pervasive computing. While deep learning has greatly enhanced localization accuracy and robustness, existing localization models still face major challenges in cross-scene generalization due to their reliance on scene-specific labeled data. To address this, we introduce Radiance-Field Reinforced Pretraining (RFRP). This novel self-supervised pretraining framework couples a large localization model (LM) with a neural radio-frequency radiance field (RF-NeRF) in an asymmetrical autoencoder architecture. In this design, the LM encodes received RF spectra into latent, position-relevant representations, while the RF-NeRF decodes them to reconstruct the original spectra. This alignment between input and output enables effective representation learning using large-scale, unlabeled RF data, which can be collected continuously with minimal effort. To this end, we collected RF samples at 7,327,321 positions across 100 diverse scenes using four common wireless technologies--RFID, BLE, WiFi, and IIoT. Data from 75 scenes were used for training, and the remaining 25 for evaluation. Experimental results show that the RFRP-pretrained LM reduces localization error by over 40% compared to non-pretrained models and by 21% compared to those pretrained using supervised learning.

## 50. Exact Synthetic Populations for Scalable Societal and Market Modeling
- **Authors**: Thierry Petit , Arnault Pachot
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07306](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07306)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce a constraint-programming framework for generating synthetic populations that reproduce target statistics with high precision while enforcing full individual consistency. Unlike data-driven approaches that infer distributions from samples, our method directly encodes aggregated statistics and structural relations, enabling exact control of demographic profiles without requiring any microdata. We validate the approach on official demographic sources and study the impact of distributional deviations on downstream analyses. This work is conducted within the Pollitics project developed by Emotia, where synthetic populations can be queried through large language models to model societal behaviors, explore market and policy scenarios, and provide reproducible decision-grade insights without personal data.

## 51. Towards Accurate UAV Image Perception: Guiding Vision-Language Models with Stronger Task Prompts
- **Authors**: Mingning Guo , Mengwei Wu , Shaoxian Li , Haifeng Li , Chao Tao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07302)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing image perception methods based on VLMs generally follow a paradigm wherein models extract and analyze image content based on user-provided textual task prompts. However, such methods face limitations when applied to UAV imagery, which presents challenges like target confusion, scale variations, and complex backgrounds. These challenges arise because VLMs' understanding of image content depends on the semantic alignment between visual and textual tokens. When the task prompt is simplistic and the image content is complex, achieving effective alignment becomes difficult, limiting the model's ability to focus on task-relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce AerialVP, the first agent framework for task prompt enhancement in UAV image perception. AerialVP proactively extracts multi-dimensional auxiliary information from UAV images to enhance task prompts, overcoming the limitations of traditional VLM-based approaches. Specifically, the enhancement process includes three stages: (1) analyzing the task prompt to identify the task type and enhancement needs, (2) selecting appropriate tools from the tool repository, and (3) generating enhanced task prompts based on the analysis and selected tools. To evaluate AerialVP, we introduce AerialSense, a comprehensive benchmark for UAV image perception that includes Aerial Visual Reasoning, Aerial Visual Question Answering, and Aerial Visual Grounding tasks. AerialSense provides a standardized basis for evaluating model generalization and performance across diverse resolutions, lighting conditions, and both urban and natural scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that AerialVP significantly enhances task prompt guidance, leading to stable and substantial performance improvements in both open-source and proprietary VLMs. Our work will be available at this https URL .

## 52. SIT-Graph: State Integrated Tool Graph for Multi-Turn Agents
- **Authors**: Sijia Li , Yuchen Huang , Zifan Liu , Zijian Li , Jingjing fu , Lei Song , Jiang Bian , Jun Zhang , Rui Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07287](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07287)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite impressive advances in agent systems, multi-turn tool-use scenarios remain challenging. It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer.

## 53. Dropout Prompt Learning: Towards Robust and Adaptive Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Biao Chen , Lin Zuo , Mengmeng Jing , Kunbin He , Yuchen Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07234](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07234)
- **Abstract**:
> Dropout is a widely used regularization technique which improves the generalization ability of a model by randomly dropping neurons. In light of this, we propose Dropout Prompt Learning, which aims for applying dropout to improve the robustness of the vision-language models. Different from the vanilla dropout, we apply dropout on the tokens of the textual and visual branches, where we evaluate the token significance considering both intra-modal context and inter-modal alignment, enabling flexible dropout probabilities for each token. Moreover, to maintain semantic alignment for general knowledge transfer while encouraging the diverse representations that dropout introduces, we further propose residual entropy regularization. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show our method's effectiveness in challenging scenarios like low-shot learning, long-tail classification, and out-of-distribution generalization. Notably, our method surpasses regularization-based methods including KgCoOp by 5.10% and PromptSRC by 2.13% in performance on base-to-novel generalization.

## 54. NeSTR: A Neuro-Symbolic Abductive Framework for Temporal Reasoning in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Feng Liang , Weixin Zeng , Runhao Zhao , Xiang Zhao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07218](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07218)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, temporal reasoning, particularly under complex temporal constraints, remains a major challenge. To this end, existing approaches have explored symbolic methods, which encode temporal structure explicitly, and reflective mechanisms, which revise reasoning errors through multi-step inference. Nonetheless, symbolic approaches often underutilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while reflective methods typically lack structured temporal representations, which can result in inconsistent or hallucinated reasoning. As a result, even when the correct temporal context is available, LLMs may still misinterpret or misapply time-related information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning (NeSTR), a novel framework that integrates structured symbolic representations with hybrid reflective reasoning to enhance the temporal sensitivity of LLM inference. NeSTR preserves explicit temporal relations through symbolic encoding, enforces logical consistency via verification, and corrects flawed inferences using abductive reflection. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal question answering benchmarks demonstrate that NeSTR achieves superior zero-shot performance and consistently improves temporal reasoning without any fine-tuning, showcasing the advantage of neuro-symbolic integration in enhancing temporal understanding in large language models.

- **Authors**: Md Selim Sarowar , Sungho Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07215](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07215)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision by providing rich semantic and geometric representations. This paper presents a comprehensive visual comparison between CLIP based and DINOv2 based approaches for 3D pose estimation in hand object grasping scenarios. We evaluate both models on the task of 6D object pose estimation and demonstrate their complementary strengths: CLIP excels in semantic understanding through language grounding, while DINOv2 provides superior dense geometric features. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that CLIP based methods achieve better semantic consistency, while DINOv2 based approaches demonstrate competitive performance with enhanced geometric precision. Our analysis provides insights for selecting appropriate vision models for robotic manipulation and grasping, picking applications.

## 56. START: Spatial and Textual Learning for Chart Understanding

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07186](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07186)
- **Abstract**:
> Chart understanding is crucial for deploying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios such as analyzing scientific papers and technical reports. Unlike natural images, charts pair a structured visual layout (spatial property) with an underlying data representation (textual property) -- grasping both is essential for precise, fine-grained chart reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose START, the Spatial and Textual learning for chART understanding. Specifically, we introduce (i) chart-element grounding and (ii) chart-to-code generation to strengthen an MLLM's understanding of both chart visual layout and data details. To facilitate spatial and textual learning, we propose the START-Dataset generated with a novel data-generation pipeline that first leverages an MLLM to translate real chart images into executable chart code, recovering the underlying data representation while preserving the visual distribution of real-world charts. We then evolve the code with a Large Language Model (LLM) to ascertain the positions of chart elements that capture the chart's visual structure, addressing challenges that existing methods cannot handle. To evaluate a model's ability to understand chart spatial structures, we propose the Chart Spatial understanding Benchmark (CS-Bench), filling a critical gap in comprehensive chart understanding evaluation. Leveraging spatial and textual learning, START delivers consistent gains across model sizes and benchmarks over the base models and surpasses prior state-of-the-art by a clear margin. Code, data and models will be publicly available.

- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal human action recognition (HAR) leverages complementary sensors for activity classification. Beyond recognition, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable detailed descriptions and causal reasoning, motivating new tasks: human action understanding (HAU) and human action reasoning (HARn). However, most LLMs, especially large vision language models (LVLMs), struggle with non-RGB modalities such as depth, IMU, and mmWave due to the lack of large-scale data-caption resources. Existing HAR datasets mainly provide coarse data-label annotations, which are insufficient to capture fine-grained action dynamics needed for HAU and HARn. We consider two ground-truth pair types: (1) data label (discrete category) and (2) data caption (textual description). Naively generating captions from labels often lacks logical and spatiotemporal consistency. We introduce CUHK-X, a large-scale multimodal dataset and benchmark suite for HAR, HAU, and HARn. CUHK-X contains 58,445 samples covering 40 actions performed by 30 participants across two indoor environments. To improve caption consistency, we propose a prompt-based scene creation method that leverages LLMs to generate logically connected activity sequences, followed by human validation. CUHK-X includes three benchmarks with six evaluation tasks. Experiments report average accuracies of 76.52% (HAR), 40.76% (HAU), and 70.25% (HARn). CUHK-X aims to enable the community to apply and develop data-intensive learning methods for robust, multimodal human activity analysis. Project page and code: this https URL and this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07132](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07132)
- **Abstract**:
> Specialized visual tools can augment large language models or vision language models with expert knowledge (e.g., grounding, spatial reasoning, medical knowledge, etc.), but knowing which tools to call (and when to call them) can be challenging. We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement.

## 59. RisConFix: LLM-based Automated Repair of Risk-Prone Drone Configurations
- **Authors**: Liping Han , Tingting Nie , Le Yu , Mingzhe Hu , Tao Yue
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07122](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07122)
- **Abstract**:
> Flight control software is typically designed with numerous configurable parameters governing multiple functionalities, enabling flexible adaptation to mission diversity and environmental uncertainty. Although developers and manufacturers usually provide recommendations for these parameters to ensure safe and stable operations, certain combinations of parameters with recommended values may still lead to unstable flight behaviors, thereby degrading the drone's robustness. To this end, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) based approach for real-time repair of risk-prone configurations (named RisConFix) that degrade drone robustness. RisConFix continuously monitors the drone's operational state and automatically triggers a repair mechanism once abnormal flight behaviors are detected. The repair mechanism leverages an LLM to analyze relationships between configuration parameters and flight states, and then generates corrective parameter updates to restore flight stability. To ensure the validity of the updated configuration, RisConFix operates as an iterative process; it continuously monitors the drone's flight state and, if an anomaly persists after applying an update, automatically triggers the next repair cycle. We evaluated RisConFix through a case study of ArduPilot (with 1,421 groups of misconfigurations). Experimental results show that RisConFix achieved a best repair success rate of 97% and an optimal average number of repairs of 1.17, demonstrating its capability to effectively and efficiently repair risk-prone configurations in real time.

## 60. FOAM: Blocked State Folding for Memory-Efficient LLM Training
- **Authors**: Ziqing Wen , Jiahuan Wang , Ping Luo , Dongsheng Li , Tao Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07112](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07112)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance due to their large parameter counts and extensive training data. However, their scale leads to significant memory bottlenecks during training, especially when using memory-intensive optimizers like Adam. Existing memory-efficient approaches often rely on techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD), projections, or weight freezing, which can introduce substantial computational overhead, require additional memory for projections, or degrade model performance. In this paper, we propose Folded Optimizer with Approximate Moment (FOAM), a method that compresses optimizer states by computing block-wise gradient means and incorporates a residual correction to recover lost information. Theoretically, FOAM achieves convergence rates equivalent to vanilla Adam under standard non-convex optimization settings. Empirically, FOAM reduces total training memory by approximately 50\%, eliminates up to 90\% of optimizer state memory overhead, and accelerates convergence. Furthermore, FOAM is compatible with other memory-efficient optimizers, delivering performance and throughput that match or surpass both full-rank and existing memory-efficient baselines.

## 61. The Geometry of Persona: Disentangling Personality from Reasoning in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Zhixiang Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07092](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07092)
- **Abstract**:
> Background: The deployment of personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) is currently constrained by the stability-plasticity dilemma. Prevailing alignment methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), rely on stochastic weight updates that often incur an "alignment tax" -- degrading general reasoning capabilities. Methods: We propose the Soul Engine, a framework based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis, which posits that personality traits exist as orthogonal linear subspaces. We introduce SoulBench, a dataset constructed via dynamic contextual sampling. Using a dual-head architecture on a frozen Qwen-2.5 base, we extract disentangled personality vectors without modifying the backbone weights. Results: Our experiments demonstrate three breakthroughs. First, High-Precision Profiling: The model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.011 against psychological ground truth. Second, Geometric Orthogonality: T-SNE visualization confirms that personality manifolds are distinct and continuous, allowing for "Zero-Shot Personality Injection" that maintains original model intelligence. Third, Deterministic Steering: We achieve robust control over behavior via vector arithmetic, validated through extensive ablation studies. Conclusion: This work challenges the necessity of fine-tuning for personalization. By transitioning from probabilistic prompting to deterministic latent intervention, we provide a mathematically rigorous foundation for safe, controllable AI personalization.

## 62. Leveraging KV Similarity for Online Structured Pruning in LLMs
- **Authors**: Jungmin Lee , Gwangeun Byeon , Yulhwa Kim , Seokin Hong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07090](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07090)
- **Abstract**:
> Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, yet existing approaches often suffer from instability because they rely on offline calibration data that may not generalize across inputs. In this work, we introduce Token Filtering, a lightweight online structured pruning technique that makes pruning decisions directly during inference without any calibration data. The key idea is to measure token redundancy via joint key-value similarity and skip redundant attention computations, thereby reducing inference cost while preserving critical information. To further enhance stability, we design a variance-aware fusion strategy that adaptively weights key and value similarity across heads, ensuring that informative tokens are retained even under high pruning ratios. This design introduces no additional memory overhead and provides a more reliable criterion for token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-2 (7B/13B), LLaMA-3 (8B), and Mistral (7B) demonstrate that Token Filtering consistently outperforms prior structured pruning methods, preserving accuracy on commonsense reasoning benchmarks and maintaining strong performance on challenging tasks such as MMLU, even with 50% pruning.

## 63. ThinkTrap: Denial-of-Service Attacks against Black-box LLM Services via Infinite Thinking
- **Authors**: Yunzhe Li , Jianan Wang , Hongzi Zhu , James Lin , Shan Chang , Minyi Guo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07086](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07086)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational components in a wide range of applications, including natural language understanding and generation, embodied intelligence, and scientific discovery. As their computational requirements continue to grow, these models are increasingly deployed as cloud-based services, allowing users to access powerful LLMs via the Internet. However, this deployment model introduces a new class of threat: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unbounded reasoning, where adversaries craft specially designed inputs that cause the model to enter excessively long or infinite generation loops. These attacks can exhaust backend compute resources, degrading or denying service to legitimate users. To mitigate such risks, many LLM providers adopt a closed-source, black-box setting to obscure model internals. In this paper, we propose ThinkTrap, a novel input-space optimization framework for DoS attacks against LLM services even in black-box environments. The core idea of ThinkTrap is to first map discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, then undertake efficient black-box optimization in a low-dimensional subspace exploiting input sparsity. The goal of this optimization is to identify adversarial prompts that induce extended or non-terminating generation across several state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving DoS with minimal token overhead. We evaluate the proposed attack across multiple commercial, closed-source LLM services. Our results demonstrate that, even far under the restrictive request frequency limits commonly enforced by these platforms, typically capped at ten requests per minute (10 RPM), the attack can degrade service throughput to as low as 1% of its original capacity, and in some cases, induce complete service failure.

- **Authors**: Genevieve Caumartin , Glaucia Melo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07022)
- **Abstract**:
> Bug localization remains a critical yet time-consuming challenge in large-scale software repositories. Traditional information retrieval-based bug localization (IRBL) methods rely on unchanged bug descriptions, which often contain noisy information, leading to poor retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved bug localization through query reformulation, yet the effect on agent performance remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate how an LLM-powered agent can improve file-level bug localization via lightweight query reformulation and summarization. We first employ an open-source, non-fine-tuned LLM to extract key information from bug reports, such as identifiers and code snippets, and reformulate queries pre-retrieval. Our agent then orchestrates BM25 retrieval using these preprocessed queries, automating localization workflow at scale. Using the best-performing query reformulation technique, our agent achieves 35% better ranking in first-file retrieval than our BM25 baseline and up to +22% file retrieval performance over SWE-agent.

- **Authors**: Zhiyu Xu , Jia Liu , Yixin Wang , Yuqi Gu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07019)
- **Abstract**:
> The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates valid evaluation methods to provide guidance for both downstream applications and actionable future improvements. The Item Response Theory (IRT) model with Computerized Adaptive Testing has recently emerged as a promising framework for evaluating LLMs via their response accuracy. Beyond simple response accuracy, LLMs' chain of thought (CoT) lengths serve as a vital indicator of their reasoning ability. To leverage the CoT length information to assist the evaluation of LLMs, we propose the Latency-Response Theory (LaRT) model, which jointly models both the response accuracy and CoT length by introducing a key correlation parameter between the latent ability and the latent speed. We derive an efficient stochastic approximation Expectation-Maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. We establish rigorous identifiability results for the latent ability and latent speed parameters to ensure the statistical validity of their estimation. Through both theoretical asymptotic analyses and simulation studies, we demonstrate LaRT's advantages over IRT in terms of superior estimation accuracy and shorter confidence intervals for latent trait estimation. To evaluate LaRT in real data, we collect responses from diverse LLMs on popular benchmark datasets. We find that LaRT yields different LLM rankings than IRT and outperforms IRT across multiple key evaluation metrics including predictive power, item efficiency, ranking validity, and LLM evaluation efficiency.

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have significantly reduced hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding responses in external context. However, standard RAG architectures suffer from a critical vulnerability: Retrieval Sycophancy. When presented with a query based on a false premise or a common misconception, vector-based retrievers tend to fetch documents that align with the user's bias rather than objective truth, leading the model to "hallucinate with citations." In this work, we introduce Falsification-Verification Alignment RAG (FVA-RAG), a framework that shifts the retrieval paradigm from Inductive Verification (seeking support) to Deductive Falsification (seeking disproof). Unlike existing "Self-Correction" methods that rely on internal consistency, FVA-RAG deploys a distinct Adversarial Retrieval Policy that actively generates "Kill Queries"-targeted search terms designed to surface contradictory evidence. We introduce a dual-verification mechanism that explicitly weighs the draft answer against this "Anti-Context." Preliminary experiments on a dataset of common misconceptions demonstrate that FVA-RAG significantly improves robustness against sycophantic hallucinations compared to standard RAG baselines, effectively acting as an inference-time "Red Team" for factual generation.

- **Abstract**:
> Automated singing assessment is crucial for education and entertainment. However, existing systems face two fundamental limitations: reliance on reference tracks, which stifles creative expression, and the simplification of complex performances into non-diagnostic scores based solely on pitch and rhythm. We advocate for a shift from discriminative to descriptive evaluation, creating a complete ecosystem for reference-free, multi-dimensional assessment. First, we introduce Sing-MD, a large-scale dataset annotated by experts across four dimensions: breath control, timbre quality, emotional expression, and vocal technique. Our analysis reveals significant annotation inconsistencies among experts, challenging the validity of traditional accuracy-based metrics. Second, addressing the memory limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in analyzing full-length songs, we propose VocalVerse. This efficient hybrid architecture leverages a lightweight acoustic encoder to model global performance features and long-term dependencies. Third, to address automated metric shortcomings, we establish the H-TPR (Human-in-the-loop Tiered Perceptual Ranking) benchmark, which evaluates a model's ability to generate perceptually valid rankings rather than predicting noisy ground-truth scores.

- **Authors**: Jing Jie Tan , Ban-Hoe Kwan , Danny Wee-Kiat Ng , Yan-Chai Hum , Anissa Mokraoui , Shih-Yu Lo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06991](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06991)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. This research introduces a novel "Prompting-in-a-Series" algorithm, termed PICEPR (Psychology-Informed Contents Embeddings for Personality Recognition), featuring two pipelines: (a) Contents and (b) Embeddings. The approach demonstrates how a modularised decoder-only LLM can summarize or generate content, which can aid in classifying or enhancing personality recognition functions as a personality feature extractor and a generator for personality-rich content. We conducted various experiments to provide evidence to justify the rationale behind the PICEPR algorithm. Meanwhile, we also explored closed-source models such as \textit{gpt4o} from OpenAI and \textit{gemini} from Google, along with open-source models like \textit{mistral} from Mistral AI, to compare the quality of the generated content. The PICEPR algorithm has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance for personality recognition by 5-15\% improvement. The work repository and models' weight can be found at this https URL .

- **Authors**: Ziyang Song , Zelin Zang , Xiaofan Ye , Boqiang Xu , Long Bai , Jinlin Wu , Hongliang Ren , Hongbin Liu , Jiebo Luo , Zhen Lei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06921](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06921)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in surgical video understanding. With improved zero-shot performance and more effective human-machine interaction, they provide a strong foundation for advancing surgical education and assistance. However, existing research and datasets primarily focus on understanding surgical procedures and workflows, while paying limited attention to the critical role of anatomical comprehension. In clinical practice, surgeons rely heavily on precise anatomical understanding to interpret, review, and learn from surgical videos. To fill this gap, we introduce the Neurosurgical Anatomy Benchmark (NeuroABench), the first multimodal benchmark explicitly created to evaluate anatomical understanding in the neurosurgical domain. NeuroABench consists of 9 hours of annotated neurosurgical videos covering 89 distinct procedures and is developed using a novel multimodal annotation pipeline with multiple review cycles. The benchmark evaluates the identification of 68 clinical anatomical structures, providing a rigorous and standardized framework for assessing model performance. Experiments on over 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations, with the best-performing model achieving only 40.87% accuracy in anatomical identification tasks. To further evaluate the benchmark, we extract a subset of the dataset and conduct an informative test with four neurosurgical trainees. The results show that the best-performing student achieves 56% accuracy, with the lowest scores of 28% and an average score of 46.5%. While the best MLLM performs comparably to the lowest-scoring student, it still lags significantly behind the group's average performance. This comparison underscores both the progress of MLLMs in anatomical understanding and the substantial gap that remains in achieving human-level performance.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06914](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06914)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into autonomous agents capable of interacting with the external world, significantly expanding their capabilities through standardized interaction protocols. However, this paradigm revives the classic cybersecurity challenges of agency and authorization in a novel and volatile context. As decision-making shifts from deterministic code logic to probabilistic inference driven by natural language, traditional security mechanisms designed for deterministic behavior fail. It is fundamentally challenging to establish trust for unpredictable AI agents and to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) when instructions are ambiguous. Despite the escalating threat landscape, the academic community's understanding of this emerging domain remains fragmented, lacking a systematic framework to analyze its root causes. This paper provides a unifying formal lens for agent-interaction security. We observed that most security threats in this domain stem from a fundamental mismatch between trust evaluation and authorization policies. We introduce a novel risk analysis model centered on this trust-authorization gap. Using this model as a unifying lens, we survey and classify the implementation paths of existing, often seemingly isolated, attacks and defenses. This new framework not only unifies the field but also allows us to identify critical research gaps. Finally, we leverage our analysis to suggest a systematic research direction toward building robust, trusted agents and dynamic authorization mechanisms.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06902](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06902)
- **Abstract**:
> As software systems evolve, developers increasingly work across multiple programming languages and often face the need to migrate code from one language to another. While automatic code translation offers a promising solution, it has long remained a challenging task. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential for this task, yet existing approaches remain limited in accuracy and fail to effectively leverage contextual and structural cues within the code. Prior work has explored translation and repair mechanisms, but lacks a structured, agentic framework where multiple specialized agents collaboratively improve translation quality. In this work, we introduce BabelCoder, an agentic framework that performs code translation by decomposing the task into specialized agents for translation, testing, and refinement, each responsible for a specific aspect such as generating code, validating correctness, or repairing errors. We evaluate BabelCoder on four benchmark datasets and compare it against four state-of-the-art baselines. BabelCoder outperforms existing methods by 0.5%-13.5% in 94% of cases, achieving an average accuracy of 94.16%.

## 72. Less Is More, but Where? Dynamic Token Compression via LLM-Guided Keyframe Prior
- **Authors**: Yulin Li , Haokun Gui , Ziyang Fan , Junjie Wang , Bin Kang , Bin Chen , Zhuotao Tian
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06866](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06866)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have achieved remarkable video understanding capabilities, yet face critical efficiency bottlenecks due to quadratic computational growth with lengthy visual token sequences of long videos. While existing keyframe sampling methods can improve temporal modeling efficiency, additional computational cost is introduced before feature encoding, and the binary frame selection paradigm is found suboptimal. Therefore, in this work, we propose Dynamic Token compression via LLM-guided Keyframe prior (DyToK), a training-free paradigm that enables dynamic token compression by harnessing VLLMs' inherent attention mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that VLLM attention layers naturally encoding query-conditioned keyframe priors, by which DyToK dynamically adjusts per-frame token retention ratios, prioritizing semantically rich frames while suppressing redundancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyToK achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs. DyToK shows plug-and-play compatibility with existing compression methods, such as VisionZip and FastV, attaining 4.3x faster inference while preserving accuracy across multiple VLLMs, such as LLaVA-OneVision and Qwen2.5-VL. Code is available at this https URL .

## 73. Formal that "Floats" High: Formal Verification of Floating Point Arithmetic
- **Authors**: Hansa Mohanty , Vaisakh Naduvodi Viswambharan , Deepak Narayan Gadde
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06850](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06850)
- **Abstract**:
> Formal verification of floating-point arithmetic remains challenging due to non-linear arithmetic behavior and the tight coupling between control and datapath logic. Existing approaches often rely on high-level C models for equivalence checking against Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, but this introduces abstraction gaps, translation overhead, and limits scalability at the RTL level. To address these challenges, this paper presents a scalable methodology for verifying floating-point arithmetic using direct RTL-to-RTL model checking against a golden reference model. The approach adopts a divide-and conquer strategy that decomposes verification into modular stages, each captured by helper assertions and lemmas that collectively prove a main correctness theorem. Counterexample (CEX)-guided refinement is used to iteratively localize and resolve implementation defects, while targeted fault injection validates the robustness of the verification process against precision-critical datapath errors. To assess scalability and practicality, the methodology is extended with agentic AI-based formal property generation, integrating large language model (LLM)-driven automation with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) refinement. Coverage analysis evaluates the effectiveness of the approach by comparing handwritten and AI-generated properties in both RTL-to-RTL model checking and standalone RTL verification settings. Results show that direct RTL-to-RTL model checking achieves higher coverage efficiency and requires fewer assertions than standalone verification, especially when combined with AI-generated properties refined through HITL guidance.

## 74. Leveraging LLMs to support co-evolution between definitions and instances of textual DSLs
- **Authors**: Weixing Zhang , Regina Hebig , Daniel Strüber
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06836](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06836)
- **Abstract**:
> Software languages evolve over time for various reasons, such as the addition of new features. When the language's grammar definition evolves, textual instances that originally conformed to the grammar become outdated. For DSLs in a model-driven engineering context, there exists a plethora of techniques to co-evolve models with the evolving metamodel. However, these techniques are not geared to support DSLs with a textual syntax -- applying them to textual language definitions and instances may lead to the loss of information from the original instances, such as comments and layout information, which are valuable for software comprehension and maintenance. This study explores the potential of Large Language Model (LLM)-based solutions in achieving grammar and instance co-evolution, with attention to their ability to preserve auxiliary information when directly processing textual instances. By applying two advanced language models, Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o, and conducting experiments across seven case languages, we evaluated the feasibility and limitations of this approach. Our results indicate a good ability of the considered LLMs for migrating textual instances in small-scale cases with limited instance size, which are representative of a subset of cases encountered in practice. In addition, we observe significant challenges with the scalability of LLM-based solutions to larger instances, leading to insights that are useful for informing future research.

## 75. RMAdapter: Reconstruction-based Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Xiang Lin , Weixin Li , Shu Guo , Lihong Wang , Di Huang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06811](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06811)
- **Abstract**:
> Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \textit{e.g.} CLIP, have become essential tools in multimodal transfer learning. However, fine-tuning VLMs in few-shot scenarios poses significant challenges in balancing task-specific adaptation and generalization in the obtained model. Meanwhile, current researches have predominantly focused on prompt-based adaptation methods, leaving adapter-based approaches underexplored and revealing notable performance gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Reconstruction-based Multimodal Adapter (RMAdapter), which leverages a dual-branch architecture. Unlike conventional single-branch adapters, RMAdapter consists of: (1) an adaptation branch that injects task-specific knowledge through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) a reconstruction branch that preserves general knowledge by reconstructing latent space features back into the original feature space. This design facilitates a dynamic balance between general and task-specific knowledge. Importantly, although RMAdapter introduces an additional reconstruction branch, it is carefully optimized to remain lightweight. By computing reconstruction loss locally at each layer and sharing projection modules, the overall computational overhead is kept minimal. A consistency constraint is also incorporated to better regulate the trade-off between discriminability and generalization. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of RMAdapter on three representative tasks: generalization to new categories, generalization to new target datasets, and domain generalization. Without relying on data augmentation or duplicate prompt designs, our RMAdapter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics.

## 76. Optimal and Diffusion Transports in Machine Learning
- **Authors**: Gabriel Peyré
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06797](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06797)
- **Abstract**:
> Several problems in machine learning are naturally expressed as the design and analysis of time-evolving probability distributions. This includes sampling via diffusion methods, optimizing the weights of neural networks, and analyzing the evolution of token distributions across layers of large language models. While the targeted applications differ (samples, weights, tokens), their mathematical descriptions share a common structure. A key idea is to switch from the Eulerian representation of densities to their Lagrangian counterpart through vector fields that advect particles. This dual view introduces challenges, notably the non-uniqueness of Lagrangian vector fields, but also opportunities to craft density evolutions and flows with favorable properties in terms of regularity, stability, and computational tractability. This survey presents an overview of these methods, with emphasis on two complementary approaches: diffusion methods, which rely on stochastic interpolation processes and underpin modern generative AI, and optimal transport, which defines interpolation by minimizing displacement cost. We illustrate how both approaches appear in applications ranging from sampling, neural network optimization, to modeling the dynamics of transformers for large language models.

## 77. From Description to Score: Can LLMs Quantify Vulnerabilities?
- **Authors**: Sima Jafarikhah , Daniel Thompson , Eva Deans , Hossein Siadati , Yi Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06781](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06781)
- **Abstract**:
> Manual vulnerability scoring, such as assigning Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores, is a resource-intensive process that is often influenced by subjective interpretation. This study investigates the potential of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), namely ChatGPT, Llama, Grok, DeepSeek, and Gemini, to automate this process by analyzing over 31{,}000 recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries. The results show that LLMs substantially outperform the baseline on certain metrics (e.g., \textit{Availability Impact}), while offering more modest gains on others (e.g., \textit{Attack Complexity}). Moreover, model performance varies across both LLM families and individual CVSS metrics, with ChatGPT-5 attaining the highest precision. Our analysis reveals that LLMs tend to misclassify many of the same CVEs, and ensemble-based meta-classifiers only marginally improve performance. Further examination shows that CVE descriptions often lack critical context or contain ambiguous phrasing, which contributes to systematic misclassifications. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing vulnerability descriptions and incorporating richer contextual details to support more reliable automated reasoning and alleviate the growing backlog of CVEs awaiting triage.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06776](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06776)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) excel at generation but dominant autoregressive (AR) decoding is inherently sequential, creating a throughput bottleneck. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs)--especially block-wise variants--enable parallel generation and intra-block bidirectional reasoning, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly and wastes the knowledge in mature AR checkpoints. Prior "adaptation" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to full-sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a block-diffusion recipe, leaving a fundamental mismatch between AR causality and block-wise bidirectionality unaddressed. We reframe adaptation as a intra-paradigm path from AR to Block-Diffusion by viewing AR as Block-Diffusion with blocksize=1. Concretely, we design the pathway of adaptation as follows: we use a context-causal attention mask (causal in context, bidirectional only within the active block), an efficient parallel adaptation procedure, an auxiliary AR loss to maximize data utilization and retain pretrained knowledge, and gradual increment of the generation block size. The recipe integrates cleanly with masked block-diffusion and maintains train-inference consistency. Built on these components, NBDiff-7B (Base and Instruct) could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs, delivering strong gains on general-knowledge, math, and code benchmarks over strong baselines. These results demonstrate that principled AR-to-block-diffusion adaptation is an effective and compute-efficient alternative to training DLMs from scratch. Codes: this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06769](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06769)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing vision-language models often suffer from spatial hallucinations, i.e., generating incorrect descriptions about the relative positions of objects in an image. We argue that this problem mainly stems from the asymmetric properties between images and text. To enrich the spatial understanding ability of vision-language models, we propose a simple, annotation-free, plug-and-play method named $\text{Stitch and Tell}$ (abbreviated as SiTe), which injects structured spatial supervision into data. It constructs stitched image-text pairs by stitching images along a spatial axis and generating spatially-aware captions or question answer pairs based on the layout of stitched image, without relying on costly advanced models or human involvement. We evaluate SiTe across three architectures including LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-Qwen2-1.5B and HALVA-7B, two training datasets, and eight benchmarks. Experiments show that SiTe improves spatial understanding tasks such as $\text{MME}_{\text{Position}}$ (+5.50%) and Spatial-MM (+4.19%), while maintaining or improving performance on general vision-language benchmarks including COCO-QA (+1.02%) and MMBench (+4.76%). Our findings suggest that explicitly injecting spatially-aware structure into training data offers an effective way to mitigate spatial hallucinations and improve spatial understanding, while preserving general vision-language capabilities.

## 80. VisChainBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Turn, Multi-Image Visual Reasoning Beyond Language Priors
- **Authors**: Wenbo Lyu , Yingjun Du , Jinglin Zhao , Xianton Zhen , Ling Shao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06759](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06759)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding multi-image, multi-turn scenarios is a critical yet underexplored capability for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on static or horizontal comparisons -- e.g., spotting visual differences or assessing appropriateness -- while relying heavily on language cues. Such settings overlook progressive, context-dependent reasoning and the challenge of visual-to-visual inference. To bridge this gap, we present VisChainBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' ability to perform multi-step visual reasoning across sequential, interdependent tasks with minimal language guidance. VisChainBench contains 1,457 tasks spanning over 20,000 images across three diverse domains (e.g., daily scenarios, engineering troubleshooting), structured to mimic real-world decision-making processes. Uniquely, the benchmark is constructed using a multi-agent generation pipeline, ensuring high visual diversity and controlled language bias. All the benchmark data and code for benchmark construction are available for viewing and download via following Link: this https URL

## 81. Becoming Experienced Judges: Selective Test-Time Learning for Evaluators
- **Authors**: Seungyeon Jwa , Daechul Ahn , Reokyoung Kim , Dongyeop Kang , Jonghyun Choi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06751)
- **Abstract**:
> Automatic evaluation with large language models, commonly known as LLM-as-a-judge, is now standard across reasoning and alignment tasks. Despite evaluating many samples in deployment, these evaluators typically (i) treat each case independently, missing the opportunity to accumulate experience, and (ii) rely on a single fixed prompt for all cases, neglecting the need for sample-specific evaluation criteria. We introduce Learning While Evaluating (LWE), a framework that allows evaluators to improve sequentially at inference time without requiring training or validation sets. LWE maintains an evolving meta-prompt that (i) produces sample-specific evaluation instructions and (ii) refines itself through self-generated feedback. Furthermore, we propose Selective LWE, which updates the meta-prompt only on self-inconsistent cases, focusing computation where it matters most. This selective approach retains the benefits of sequential learning while being far more cost-effective. Across two pairwise comparison benchmarks, Selective LWE outperforms strong baselines, empirically demonstrating that evaluators can improve during sequential testing with a simple selective update, learning most from the cases they struggle with.

- **Authors**: Jifar Wakuma Ayana , Huang Qiming
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06747](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06747)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful enablers for autonomous reasoning and natural-language coordination in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms operating within Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, existing LLM-driven UAV systems process sensitive operational data in plaintext, exposing them to privacy and security risks. This work introduces PrivLLMSwarm, a privacy-preserving framework that performs secure LLM inference for UAV swarm coordination through Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). The framework incorporates MPC-optimized transformer components with efficient approximations of nonlinear activations, enabling practical encrypted inference on resource-constrained aerial platforms. A fine-tuned GPT-based command generator, enhanced through reinforcement learning in simulation, provides reliable instructions while maintaining confidentiality. Experimental evaluation in urban-scale simulations demonstrates that PrivLLMSwarm achieves high semantic accuracy, low encrypted inference latency, and robust formation control under privacy constraints. Comparative analysis shows PrivLLMSwarm offers a superior privacy-utility balance compared to differential privacy, federated learning, and plaintext baselines. To support reproducibility, the full implementation including source code, MPC components, and a synthetic dataset is publicly available. PrivLLMSwarm establishes a practical foundation for secure, LLM-enabled UAV swarms in privacy-sensitive IoT applications including smart-city monitoring and emergency response.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06746)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted for AI-generated images (AIGI) detection, yet converting VLMs into detectors requires substantial resource, while the resulting models still exhibit severe hallucinations. To probe the core issue, we conduct an empirical analysis and observe two characteristic behaviors: (i) fine-tuning VLMs on high-level semantic supervision strengthens semantic discrimination and well generalize to unseen data; (ii) fine-tuning VLMs on low-level pixel-artifact supervision yields poor transfer. We attribute VLMs' underperformance to task-model misalignment: semantics-oriented VLMs inherently lack sensitivity to fine-grained pixel artifacts, and semantically non-discriminative pixel artifacts thus exceeds their inductive biases. In contrast, we observe that conventional pixel-artifact detectors capture low-level pixel artifacts yet exhibit limited semantic awareness relative to VLMs, highlighting that distinct models are better matched to distinct tasks. In this paper, we formalize AIGI detection as two complementary tasks--semantic consistency checking and pixel-artifact detection--and show that neglecting either induces systematic blind spots. Guided by this view, we introduce the Task-Model Alignment principle and instantiate it as a two-branch detector, AlignGemini, comprising a VLM fine-tuned exclusively with pure semantic supervision and a pixel-artifact expert trained exclusively with pure pixel-artifact supervision. By enforcing orthogonal supervision on two simplified datasets, each branch trains to its strengths, producing complementary discrimination over semantic and pixel cues. On five in-the-wild benchmarks, AlignGemini delivers a +9.5 gain in average accuracy, supporting task-model alignment as an effective path to generalizable AIGI detection.

- **Authors**: Subrit Dikshit , Ritu Tiwari , Priyank Jain
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06734)
- **Abstract**:
> Transfer Learning (TL) has accelerated the rapid development and availability of large language models (LLMs) for mainstream natural language processing (NLP) use cases. However, training and deploying such gigantic LLMs in resource-constrained, real-world healthcare situations remains challenging. This study addresses the limited support available to visually impaired users and speakers of low-resource languages such as Hindi who require medical assistance in rural environments. We propose PDFTEMRA (Performant Distilled Frequency Transformer Ensemble Model with Random Activations), a compact transformer-based architecture that integrates model distillation, frequency-domain modulation, ensemble learning, and randomized activation patterns to reduce computational cost while preserving language understanding performance. The model is trained and evaluated on medical question-answering and consultation datasets tailored to Hindi and accessibility scenarios, and its performance is compared against standard NLP state-of-the-art model baselines. Results demonstrate that PDFTEMRA achieves comparable performance with substantially lower computational requirements, indicating its suitability for accessible, inclusive, low-resource medical NLP applications.

## 85. "The Dentist is an involved parent, the bartender is not": Revealing Implicit Biases in QA with Implicit BBQ
- **Authors**: Aarushi Wagh , Saniya Srivastava
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06732](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06732)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing benchmarks evaluating biases in large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on explicit cues, declaring protected attributes like religion, race, gender by name. However, real-world interactions often contain implicit biases, inferred subtly through names, cultural cues, or traits. This critical oversight creates a significant blind spot in fairness evaluation. We introduce ImplicitBBQ, a benchmark extending the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) with implicitly cued protected attributes across 6 categories. Our evaluation of GPT-4o on ImplicitBBQ illustrates troubling performance disparity from explicit BBQ prompts, with accuracy declining up to 7% in the "sexual orientation" subcategory and consistent decline located across most other categories. This indicates that current LLMs contain implicit biases undetected by explicit benchmarks. ImplicitBBQ offers a crucial tool for nuanced fairness evaluation in NLP.

- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable progress, particularly with the introduction of various entropy control techniques. However, the role and characteristics of entropy in perception-oriented tasks like visual grounding, as well as effective strategies for controlling it, remain largely unexplored. To address this issue, we focus on the visual grounding task and analyze the role and characteristics of entropy in comparison to reasoning tasks. Building on these findings, we introduce ECVGPO (Entropy Control Visual Grounding Policy Optimization), an interpretable algorithm designed for effective entropy regulation. Through entropy control, the trade-off between exploration and exploitation is better balanced. Experiments show that ECVGPO achieves broad improvements across various benchmarks and models.

## 87. Mechanistic Interpretability of GPT-2: Lexical and Contextual Layers in Sentiment Analysis
- **Authors**: Amartya Hatua
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06681](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06681)
- **Abstract**:
> We present a mechanistic interpretability study of GPT-2 that causally examines how sentiment information is processed across its transformer layers. Using systematic activation patching across all 12 layers, we test the hypothesized two-stage sentiment architecture comprising early lexical detection and mid-layer contextual integration. Our experiments confirm that early layers (0-3) act as lexical sentiment detectors, encoding stable, position specific polarity signals that are largely independent of context. However, all three contextual integration hypotheses: Middle Layer Concentration, Phenomenon Specificity, and Distributed Processing are falsified. Instead of mid-layer specialization, we find that contextual phenomena such as negation, sarcasm, domain shifts etc. are integrated primarily in late layers (8-11) through a unified, non-modular mechanism. These experimental findings provide causal evidence that GPT-2's sentiment computation differs from the predicted hierarchical pattern, highlighting the need for further empirical characterization of contextual integration in large language models.

However, this procedure is difficult because real-world datasets are rarely homogeneous; they consist of a mixture of diverse information, causing gradient interference, where conflicting gradients pull the model in opposing directions, degrading performance. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to group data based on semantic or embedding similarity. However, this fails to capture how data influences model parameters during learning. While recent works have attempted to cluster gradients directly, they randomly project gradients into lower dimensions to manage memory, which leads to accuracy loss. Moreover, these methods rely on expert ensembles which necessitates multiple inference passes and expensive on-the-fly gradient computations during inference. To address these limitations, we propose GradientSpace, a framework that clusters samples directly in full-dimensional gradient space. We introduce an online SVD-based algorithm that operates on LoRA gradients to identify latent skills without the infeasible cost of storing all sample gradients. Each cluster is used to train a specialized LoRA expert along with a lightweight router trained to select the best expert during inference. We show that routing to a single, appropriate expert outperforms expert ensembles used in prior work, while significantly reducing inference latency. Our experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, finance, and creative writing tasks demonstrate that GradientSpace leads to coherent expert specialization and consistent accuracy gains over state-of-the-art clustering methods and finetuning techniques.

## 89. Towards Small Language Models for Security Query Generation in SOC Workflows
- **Authors**: Saleha Muzammil , Rahul Reddy , Vishal Kamalakrishnan , Hadi Ahmadi , Wajih Ul Hassan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06660](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06660)
- **Abstract**:
> Analysts in Security Operations Centers routinely query massive telemetry streams using Kusto Query Language (KQL). Writing correct KQL requires specialized expertise, and this dependency creates a bottleneck as security teams scale. This paper investigates whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can enable accurate, cost-effective natural-language-to-KQL translation for enterprise security. We propose a three-knob framework targeting prompting, fine-tuning, and architecture design. First, we adapt existing NL2KQL framework for SLMs with lightweight retrieval and introduce error-aware prompting that addresses common parser failures without increasing token count. Second, we apply LoRA fine-tuning with rationale distillation, augmenting each NLQ-KQL pair with a brief chain-of-thought explanation to transfer reasoning from a teacher model while keeping the SLM compact. Third, we propose a two-stage architecture that uses an SLM for candidate generation and a low-cost LLM judge for schema-aware refinement and selection. We evaluate nine models (five SLMs and four LLMs) across syntax correctness, semantic accuracy, table selection, and filter precision, alongside latency and token cost. On Microsoft's NL2KQL Defender Evaluation dataset, our two-stage approach achieves 0.987 syntax and 0.906 semantic accuracy. We further demonstrate generalizability on Microsoft Sentinel data, reaching 0.964 syntax and 0.831 semantic accuracy. These results come at up to 10x lower token cost than GPT-5, establishing SLMs as a practical, scalable foundation for natural-language querying in security operations.

## 90. GSAE: Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders for Robust LLM Safety Steering
- **Authors**: Jehyeok Yeon , Federico Cinus , Yifan Wu , Luca Luceri
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06655](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06655)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) face critical safety challenges, as they can be manipulated to generate harmful content through adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks. Many defenses are typically either black-box guardrails that filter outputs, or internals-based methods that steer hidden activations by operationalizing safety as a single latent feature or dimension. While effective for simple concepts, this assumption is limiting, as recent evidence shows that abstract concepts such as refusal and temporality are distributed across multiple features rather than isolated in one. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which extends SAEs with a Laplacian smoothness penalty on the neuron co-activation graph. Unlike standard SAEs that assign each concept to a single latent feature, GSAEs recover smooth, distributed safety representations as coherent patterns spanning multiple features. We empirically demonstrate that GSAE enables effective runtime safety steering, assembling features into a weighted set of safety-relevant directions and controlling them with a two-stage gating mechanism that activates interventions only when harmful prompts or continuations are detected during generation. This approach enforces refusals adaptively while preserving utility on benign queries. Across safety and QA benchmarks, GSAE steering achieves an average 82% selective refusal rate, substantially outperforming standard SAE steering (42%), while maintaining strong task accuracy (70% on TriviaQA, 65% on TruthfulQA, 74% on GSM8K). Robustness experiments further show generalization across LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi families and resilience against jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN), consistently maintaining >= 90% refusal of harmful content.

## 91. Towards Efficient Hypergraph and Multi-LLM Agent Recommender Systems
- **Authors**: Tendai Mukande , Esraa Ali , Annalina Caputo , Ruihai Dong , Noel OConnor
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06590](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06590)
- **Abstract**:
> Recommender Systems (RSs) have become the cornerstone of various applications such as e-commerce and social media platforms. The evolution of RSs is paramount in the digital era, in which personalised user experience is tailored to the user's preferences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a new paradigm - generative retrieval and recommendation. Despite their potential, generative RS methods face issues such as hallucination, which degrades the recommendation performance, and high computational cost in practical scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce HGLMRec, a novel Multi-LLM agent-based RS that incorporates a hypergraph encoder designed to capture complex, multi-behaviour relationships between users and items. The HGLMRec model retrieves only the relevant tokens during inference, reducing computational overhead while enriching the retrieval context. Experimental results show performance improvement by HGLMRec against state-of-the-art baselines at lower computational cost.

## 92. Securing the Model Context Protocol: Defending LLMs Against Tool Poisoning and Adversarial Attacks
- **Authors**: Saeid Jamshidi , Kawser Wazed Nafi , Arghavan Moradi Dakhel , Negar Shahabi , Foutse Khomh , Naser Ezzati-Jivan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06556](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06556)
- **Abstract**:
> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Large Language Models to integrate external tools through structured descriptors, increasing autonomy in decision-making, task execution, and multi-agent workflows. However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap. Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation. This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety. DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification.

## 93. BEACON: A Unified Behavioral-Tactical Framework for Explainable Cybercrime Analysis with Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Arush Sachdeva , Rajendraprasad Saravanan , Gargi Sarkar , Kavita Vemuri , Sandeep Kumar Shukla
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06555](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06555)
- **Abstract**:
> Cybercrime increasingly exploits human cognitive biases in addition to technical vulnerabilities, yet most existing analytical frameworks focus primarily on operational aspects and overlook psychological manipulation. This paper proposes BEACON, a unified dual-dimension framework that integrates behavioral psychology with the tactical lifecycle of cybercrime to enable structured, interpretable, and scalable analysis of cybercrime. We formalize six psychologically grounded manipulation categories derived from Prospect Theory and Cialdini's principles of persuasion, alongside a fourteen-stage cybercrime tactical lifecycle spanning reconnaissance to final impact. A single large language model is fine-tuned using parameter-efficient learning to perform joint multi-label classification across both psychological and tactical dimensions while simultaneously generating human-interpretable explanations. Experiments conducted on a curated dataset of real-world and synthetically augmented cybercrime narratives demonstrate a 20 percent improvement in overall classification accuracy over the base model, along with substantial gains in reasoning quality measured using ROUGE and BERTScore. The proposed system enables automated decomposition of unstructured victim narratives into structured behavioral and operational intelligence, supporting improved cybercrime investigation, case linkage, and proactive scam detection.

## 94. A-3PO: Accelerating Asynchronous LLM Training with Staleness-aware Proximal Policy Approximation
- **Authors**: Xiaocan Li , Shiliang Wu , Zheng Shen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06547](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06547)
- **Abstract**:
> Decoupled loss has been a successful reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to deal with the high data staleness under the asynchronous RL setting. Decoupled loss improves coupled-loss style of algorithms' (e.g., PPO, GRPO) learning stability by introducing a proximal policy to decouple the off-policy corrections (importance weight) from the controlling policy updates (trust region). However, the proximal policy requires an extra forward pass through the network at each training step, creating a computational bottleneck for large language models. We observe that since the proximal policy only serves as a trust region anchor between the behavior and target policies, we can approximate it through simple interpolation without explicit computation. We call this approach A-3PO (APproximated Proximal Policy Optimization). A-3PO eliminates this overhead, reducing training time by 18% while maintaining comparable performance.

## 95. Beyond Token-level Supervision: Unlocking the Potential of Decoding-based Regression via Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Ming Chen , Sheng Tang , Rong-Xi Tan , Ziniu Li , Jiacheng Chen , Ke Xue , Chao Qian
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06533](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06533)
- **Abstract**:
> Decoding-based regression, which reformulates regression as a sequence generation task, has emerged as a promising paradigm of applying large language models for numerical prediction. However, its progress is hindered by the misalignment between discrete token-level objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and continuous numerical values. Existing approaches relying on token-level constraints often fail to capture the global magnitude of the target value, limiting their precision and generalization. In this paper, we propose to unlock the potential of decoding-based regression via Reinforcement Learning (RL). We formulate the generation process as a Markov Decision Process, utilizing sequence-level rewards to enforce global numerical coherence. Extensive experiments on tabular regression and code metric regression demonstrate that our method (specifically with ReMax and GRPO) consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art token-level baselines and traditional regression heads, showing the superiority of introducing sequence-level signals. Our analysis further reveals that RL significantly enhances sampling efficiency and predictive precision, establishing decoding-based regression as a robust and accurate paradigm for general-purpose numerical prediction.

## 96. Classifying German Language Proficiency Levels Using Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Elias-Leander Ahlers , Witold Brunsmann , Malte Schilling
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06483](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06483)
- **Abstract**:
> Assessing language proficiency is essential for education, as it enables instruction tailored to learners needs. This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically classifying German texts according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) into different proficiency levels. To support robust training and evaluation, we construct a diverse dataset by combining multiple existing CEFR-annotated corpora with synthetic data. We then evaluate prompt-engineering strategies, fine-tuning of a LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model and a probing-based approach that utilizes the internal neural state of the LLM for classification. Our results show a consistent performance improvement over prior methods, highlighting the potential of LLMs for reliable and scalable CEFR classification.

## 97. Vec-LUT: Vector Table Lookup for Parallel Ultra-Low-Bit LLM Inference on Edge Devices
- **Authors**: Xiangyu Li , Chengyu Yin , Weijun Wang , Jianyu Wei , Ting Cao , Yunxin Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06443](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06443)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on edge devices. To meet strict resource constraints, real-world deployment has pushed LLM quantization from 8-bit to 4-bit, 2-bit, and now 1.58-bit. Combined with lookup table (LUT)-based inference, CPUs run these ultra-low-bit LLMs even faster than NPUs, opening new opportunities for ubiquitous on-device intelligence. However, this paper identifies that LUT-based inference underutilizes memory bandwidth during parallel inference, which is required for prefilling, test-time scaling, and other multi-token scenarios. The root cause is the scalar LUT paradigm, which performs repetitive and non-contiguous memory accesses for each token. To solve the issue, we propose vector LUT, a new lookup paradigm that constructs a unified LUT across parallel tokens, and performs a single $1 \rightarrow N$ lookup per index. To realize it efficiently, we further introduce (1) Vector LUT-Centric Tensor Layout, and (2) Cache-Aware Streamed Lookup techniques. Evaluations on 5 edge devices across 3 LLMs show that Vec-LUT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to $4.2\times$. Our implementation is integrated into this http URL .

- **Authors**: Shovan Roy
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06396](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06396)
- **Abstract**:
> The increasing complexity of cyber threats in distributed environments demands advanced frameworks for real-time detection and response across multimodal data streams. This paper introduces AgenticCyber, a generative AI powered multi-agent system that orchestrates specialized agents to monitor cloud logs, surveillance videos, and environmental audio concurrently. The solution achieves 96.2% F1-score in threat detection, reduces response latency to 420 ms, and enables adaptive security posture management using multimodal language models like Google's Gemini coupled with LangChain for agent orchestration. Benchmark datasets, such as AWS CloudTrail logs, UCF-Crime video frames, and UrbanSound8K audio clips, show greater performance over standard intrusion detection systems, reducing mean time to respond (MTTR) by 65% and improving situational awareness. This work introduces a scalable, modular proactive cybersecurity architecture for enterprise networks and IoT ecosystems that overcomes siloed security technologies with cross-modal reasoning and automated remediation.

- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the de-facto paradigm for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We have developed RLAX, a scalable RL framework on TPUs. RLAX employs a parameter-server architecture. A master trainer periodically pushes updated model weights to the parameter server while a fleet of inference workers pull the latest weights and generates new rollouts. We introduce a suite of system techniques to enable scalable and preemptible RL for a diverse set of state-of-art RL algorithms. To accelerate convergence and improve model quality, we have devised new dataset curation and alignment techniques. Large-scale evaluations show that RLAX improves QwQ-32B's pass@8 accuracy by 12.8% in just 12 hours 48 minutes on 1024 v5p TPUs, while remaining robust to preemptions during training.

## 100. Protecting Bystander Privacy via Selective Hearing in LALMs
- **Authors**: Xiao Zhan , Guangzhi Sun , Jose Such , Phil Woodland
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06380](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06380)
- **Abstract**:
> Large audio language models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings where they inevitably capture speech from unintended nearby bystanders, raising privacy risks that existing benchmarks and defences largely overlook. We introduce SH-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate selective hearing: a model's ability to attend to an intended main speaker while refusing to process or reveal information about incidental bystander speech. SH-Bench contains 3,968 multi-speaker audio mixtures spanning both real-world and synthetic scenarios, paired with 77k multiple-choice questions that probe models under general and selective operating modes. We propose Selective Efficacy (SE), a unified metric capturing both multi-speaker comprehension and bystander-privacy protection. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LALMs reveals substantial privacy leakage, with strong audio understanding failing to translate into selective protection of bystander privacy. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Bystander Privacy Fine-Tuning (BPFT), a training pipeline that teaches models to refuse bystander-related queries without degrading main-speaker comprehension. BPFT yields substantial gains which improve SE by up to 15.9% over Gemini 2.5 Pro, demonstrating that selective hearing is learnable but far from achieved in current LALMs. SH-Bench and BPFT provide the first systematic framework for measuring and improving bystander privacy in audio foundation models.

## 101. When Distance Distracts: Representation Distance Bias in BT-Loss for Reward Models
- **Authors**: Tong Xie , Andrew Bai , Yuanhao Ban , Yunqi Hong , Haoyu Li , Cho-jui Hsieh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06343)
- **Abstract**:
> Reward models are central to Large Language Model (LLM) alignment within the framework of RLHF. The standard objective used in reward modeling is the Bradley-Terry (BT) loss, which learns from pairwise data consisting of a pair of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we analyze the per-sample gradient of BT-loss and show that its norm scales with two distinct components: (1) the difference in predicted rewards between chosen and rejected responses, which reflects the prediction error, and critically, (2) representation distance between the pair measured in the output space of the final layer. While the first term captures the intended training signal, we show that the second term can significantly impact the update magnitude and misalign learning. Specifically, pairs with small representation distance often receive vanishingly weak updates, even when misranked, while pairs with large distance receive disproportionately strong updates. This leads to gradients from large-distance pairs to overshadow those from small-distance pairs, where fine-grained distinctions are especially important. To overcome this limitation, we propose NormBT, an adaptive pair-wise normalization scheme that balances representation-driven effects and focuses learning signals on prediction error. NormBT is a lightweight, drop-in integration to BT loss with negligible overhead. Across various LLM backbones and datasets, NormBT improves reward model performance consistently, with notable gains of over 5% on the Reasoning category of RewardBench, which contains numerous small-distance pairs. This work reveals a key limitation in the widely used BT objective and provides a simple, effective correction.

## 102. Chemistry Integrated Language Model using Hierarchical Molecular Representation for Polymer Informatics
- **Authors**: Jihun Ahn , Gabriella Pasya Irianti , Vikram Thapar , Su-Mi Hur
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06301](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06301)
- **Abstract**:
> Machine learning has transformed material discovery for inorganic compounds and small molecules, yet polymers remain largely inaccessible to these methods. While data scarcity is often cited as the primary bottleneck, we demonstrate that strategic molecular representations can overcome this limitation. We introduce CI-LLM (Chemically Informed Language Model), a framework combining HAPPY (Hierarchically Abstracted rePeat unit of PolYmer), which encodes chemical substructures as tokens, with numerical descriptors within transformer architectures. For property prediction, De$^3$BERTa, our descriptor-enriched encoder, achieves 3.5x faster inference than SMILES-based models with improved accuracy ($R^2$ score gains of 0.9-4.1 percent across four properties), while providing interpretable structure-property insights at the subgroup level. For inverse design, our GPT-based generator produces polymers with targeted properties, achieving 100 percent scaffold retention and successful multi-property optimization for negatively correlated objectives. This comprehensive framework demonstrates both forward prediction and inverse design capabilities, showcasing how strategic molecular representation advances machine learning applications in polymer science.

## 103. Unleashing the Intrinsic Visual Representation Capability of Multimodal Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Hengzhuang Li , Xinsong Zhang , Qiming Peng , Bin Luo , Han Hu , Dengyang Jiang , Han-Jia Ye , Teng Zhang , Hai Jin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06281](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06281)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in multimodal tasks. Despite their impressive performance, MLLMs suffer from the modality imbalance issue, where visual information is often underutilized compared to textual representations in deeper layers, leading to degraded visual performance or hallucinations. This issue stems from the predominant reliance on next-text-token-prediction during training, which fails to provide direct visual supervisory signals, resulting in progressive homogenization of visual representations throughout the layers. To this end, we propose Latent Visual Reconstruction (LaVer), a novel training framework that facilitates MLLMs in learning more discriminative visual representations via masked image modeling in the joint latent semantic space of LLM. Our method offers direct visual activation to MLLMs, which exhibit increased visual attention allocation, indicating enhanced utilization of visual information. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks prove the superiority of our approach in various scenarios, especially those requiring dense visual capabilities. Code of LaVer is available at this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06276](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06276)
- **Abstract**:
> Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a vision-language task that localizes a specific image region based on a textual description. Existing REC benchmarks primarily evaluate perceptual capabilities and lack interpretable scoring mechanisms, which cannot reveal the grounding capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) across different cognitive abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce RefBench-PRO, a comprehensive REC benchmark, which decomposes referring expressions into two core dimensions, i.e., perception and reasoning, and further subdivides them into six progressively challenging tasks, such as attribute, position, interaction, commonsense, relation and reject. We also develop a fully automated data-generation pipeline that produces diverse referring expressions across these six sub-dimensions. Furthermore, We propose Ref-R1, an RL-based learning scheme, which incorporates Dynamic IoU-based GRPO to improve localization accuracy under increasingly complex reasoning conditions, establishing a stronger baseline for REC. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RefBench-PRO enables interpretable evaluation of MLLM on referring expression comprehension, presenting greater challenges in both perception and reasoning.

## 105. Who Will Top the Charts? Multimodal Music Popularity Prediction via Adaptive Fusion of Modality Experts and Temporal Engagement Modeling
- **Authors**: Yash Choudhary , Preeti Rao , Pushpak Bhattacharyya
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06259](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06259)
- **Abstract**:
> Predicting a song's commercial success prior to its release remains an open and critical research challenge for the music industry. Early prediction of music popularity informs strategic decisions, creative planning, and marketing. Existing methods suffer from four limitations:(i) temporal dynamics in audio and lyrics are averaged away; (ii) lyrics are represented as a bag of words, disregarding compositional structure and affective semantics; (iii) artist- and song-level historical performance is ignored; and (iv) multimodal fusion approaches rely on simple feature concatenation, resulting in poorly aligned shared representations. To address these limitations, we introduce GAMENet, an end-to-end multimodal deep learning architecture for music popularity prediction. GAMENet integrates modality-specific experts for audio, lyrics, and social metadata through an adaptive gating mechanism. We use audio features from Music4AllOnion processed via OnionEnsembleAENet, a network of autoencoders designed for robust feature extraction; lyric embeddings derived through a large language model pipeline; and newly introduced Career Trajectory Dynamics (CTD) features that capture multi-year artist career momentum and song-level trajectory statistics. Using the Music4All dataset (113k tracks), previously explored in MIR tasks but not popularity prediction, GAMENet achieves a 12% improvement in R^2 over direct multimodal feature concatenation. Spotify audio descriptors alone yield an R^2 of 0.13. Integrating aggregate CTD features increases this to 0.69, with an additional 7% gain from temporal CTD features. We further validate robustness using the SpotGenTrack Popularity Dataset (100k tracks), achieving a 16% improvement over the previous baseline. Extensive ablations confirm the model's effectiveness and the distinct contribution of each modality.

## 106. Convergence of Outputs When Two Large Language Models Interact in a Multi-Agentic Setup
- **Authors**: Aniruddha Maiti , Satya Nimmagadda , Kartha Veerya Jammuladinne , Niladri Sengupta , Ananya Jana
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06256)
- **Abstract**:
> In this work, we report what happens when two large language models respond to each other for many turns without any outside input in a multi-agent setup. The setup begins with a short seed sentence. After that, each model reads the other's output and generates a response. This continues for a fixed number of steps. We used Mistral Nemo Base 2407 and Llama 2 13B hf. We observed that most conversations start coherently but later fall into repetition. In many runs, a short phrase appears and repeats across turns. Once repetition begins, both models tend to produce similar output rather than introducing a new direction in the conversation. This leads to a loop where the same or similar text is produced repeatedly. We describe this behavior as a form of convergence. It occurs even though the models are large, trained separately, and not given any prompt instructions. To study this behavior, we apply lexical and embedding-based metrics to measure how far the conversation drifts from the initial seed and how similar the outputs of the two models becomes as the conversation progresses.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06247](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06247)
- **Abstract**:
> AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are being used to solve increasingly complex software engineering challenges, but struggle with hardware design tasks. Register Transfer Level (RTL) code presents a unique challenge for LLMs, as it encodes complex, dynamic, time-evolving behaviors using the low-level language features of SystemVerilog. LLMs struggle to infer these complex behaviors from the syntax of RTL alone, which limits their ability to complete all downstream tasks like code completion, documentation, or verification. In response to this issue, we present DUET: a general methodology for developing Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing. DUET mimics how hardware design experts develop an understanding of complex designs: not just via a one-off readthrough of the RTL, but via iterative experimentation using a number of tools. DUET iteratively generates hypotheses, tests them with EDA tools (e.g., simulation, waveform inspection, and formal verification), and integrates the results to build a bottom-up understanding of the design. In our evaluations, we show that DUET improves AI agent performance on formal verification, when compared to a baseline flow without experimentation.

## 108. Do You Feel Comfortable? Detecting Hidden Conversational Escalation in AI Chatbots
- **Authors**: Jihyung Park , Saleh Afroogh , Junfeng Jiao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06193](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06193)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly integrated into everyday interactions, serving not only as information assistants but also as emotional companions. Even in the absence of explicit toxicity, repeated emotional reinforcement or affective drift can gradually escalate distress in a form of \textit{implicit harm} that traditional toxicity filters fail to detect. Existing guardrail mechanisms often rely on external classifiers or clinical rubrics that may lag behind the nuanced, real-time dynamics of a developing conversation. To address this gap, we propose GAUGE (Guarding Affective Utterance Generation Escalation), a lightweight, logit-based framework for the real-time detection of hidden conversational escalation. GAUGE measures how an LLM's output probabilistically shifts the affective state of a dialogue.

- **Abstract**:
> What if users could meet their future selves today? AI-generated future selves simulate meaningful encounters with a digital twin decades in the future. As AI systems advance, combining cloned voices, age-progressed facial rendering, and autobiographical narratives, a central question emerges: Does the modality of these future selves alter their psychological and affective impact? How might a text-based chatbot, a voice-only system, or a photorealistic avatar shape present-day decisions and our feeling of connection to the future? We report a randomized controlled study (N=92) evaluating three modalities of AI-generated future selves (text, voice, avatar) against a neutral control condition. We also report a systematic model evaluation between Claude 4 and three other Large Language Models (LLMs), assessing Claude 4 across psychological and interaction dimensions and establishing conversational AI quality as a critical determinant of intervention effectiveness. All personalized modalities strengthened Future Self-Continuity (FSC), emotional well-being, and motivation compared to control, with avatar producing the largest vividness gains, yet with no significant differences between formats. Interaction quality metrics, particularly persuasiveness, realism, and user engagement, emerged as robust predictors of psychological and affective outcomes, indicating that how compelling the interaction feels matters more than the form it takes. Content analysis found thematic patterns: text emphasized career planning, while voice and avatar facilitated personal reflection. Claude 4 outperformed ChatGPT 3.5, Llama 4, and Qwen 3 in enhancing psychological, affective, and FSC outcomes.

> Deep learning has demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma classification, positioning it as a powerful tool in clinical dermatology. However, model opacity and the lack of interpretability remain critical barriers to clinical adoption, as clinicians often struggle to trust the decision-making processes of black-box models. To address this gap, we present a Cross-modal Explainable Framework for Melanoma (CEFM) that leverages contrastive learning as the core mechanism for achieving interpretability. Specifically, CEFM maps clinical criteria for melanoma diagnosis-namely Asymmetry, Border, and Color (ABC)-into the Vision Transformer embedding space using dual projection heads, thereby aligning clinical semantics with visual features. The aligned representations are subsequently translated into structured textual explanations via natural language generation, creating a transparent link between raw image data and clinical interpretation. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate 92.79% accuracy and an AUC of 0.961, along with significant improvements across multiple interpretability metrics. Qualitative analyses further show that the spatial arrangement of the learned embeddings aligns with clinicians' application of the ABC rule, effectively bridging the gap between high-performance classification and clinical trust.

- **Abstract**:
> General-purpose large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative and reasoning capabilities but remain limited in healthcare and caregiving applications due to two key deficiencies: factual unreliability and a lack of empathetic communication. These shortcomings pose significant risks in sensitive contexts where users, particularly non-professionals and caregivers, seek medically relevant guidance or emotional reassurance. To address these challenges, we introduce a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based alignment framework designed to improve factual correctness, semantic coherence, and human-centric qualities such as empathy, politeness, and simplicity in caregiver-patient dialogues. Our approach fine-tunes domain-adapted LLMs using pairwise preference data, where preferred responses reflect supportive and accessible communication styles while rejected ones represent prescriptive or overly technical tones. This direct optimization method aligns model outputs with human preferences more efficiently than traditional reinforcement-learning-based alignment. Empirical evaluations across multiple open and proprietary LLMs show that our DPO-tuned models achieve higher semantic alignment, improved factual accuracy, and stronger human-centric evaluation scores compared to baseline and commercial alternatives such as Google medical dialogue systems. These improvements demonstrate that preference-based alignment offers a scalable and transparent pathway toward developing trustworthy, empathetic, and clinically informed AI assistants for caregiver and healthcare communication.

## 112. Reinforcement Learning Integrated Agentic RAG for Software Test Cases Authoring
- **Authors**: Mohanakrishnan Hariharan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06060](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06060)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper introduces a framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with autonomous agents to enable continuous improvement in the automated process of software test cases authoring from business requirement documents within Quality Engineering (QE) workflows. Conventional systems employing Large Language Models (LLMs) generate test cases from static knowledge bases, which fundamentally limits their capacity to enhance performance over time. Our proposed Reinforcement Infused Agentic RAG (Retrieve, Augment, Generate) framework overcomes this limitation by employing AI agents that learn from QE feedback, assessments, and defect discovery outcomes to automatically improve their test case generation strategies. The system combines specialized agents with a hybrid vector-graph knowledge base that stores and retrieves software testing knowledge. Through advanced RL algorithms, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), these agents optimize their behavior based on QE-reported test effectiveness, defect detection rates, and workflow metrics. As QEs execute AI-generated test cases and provide feedback, the system learns from this expert guidance to improve future iterations. Experimental validation on enterprise Apple projects yielded substantive improvements: a 2.4% increase in test generation accuracy (from 94.8% to 97.2%), and a 10.8% improvement in defect detection rates. The framework establishes a continuous knowledge refinement loop driven by QE expertise, resulting in progressively superior test case quality that enhances, rather than replaces, human testing capabilities.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06042](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06042)
- **Abstract**:
> Machine learning (ML) models for code clone detection determine whether two pieces of code are semantically equivalent, which in turn is a key building block for software-engineering tasks like refactoring and security tasks like vulnerability and malware detection. While these models are predominantly trained on clean, structured code datasets, real-world code often undergoes a variety of semantic-preserving transformations, including refactoring, minification, automated formatting, and compiler optimizations. To address this critical gap between training and test data, we propose Auto-SPT, a novel framework to automatically construct synthetic-data generators for code. Auto-SPT is designed to produce Semantic Preserving Transformations (SPTs) that alter a program's syntactic structure while preserving its functionality and is instantiated on top of Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, we use LLMs to craft a diverse set of SPTs, generate strong implementations for these SPTs, and compose them to result into strong transformations. Our formal analysis shows that the diversity of SPTs impacts the strength of their composition. We then empirically demonstrate that Auto-SPT generates more diverse SPTs than existing approaches and these SPTs significantly drop the performance of state-of-the-art code clone detectors. Further experiments show Auto-SPT can be used to enhance code datasets for training, to produce code-clone detection models that are robust to real-world, adversarial code transformations.

## 114. PrefGen: Multimodal Preference Learning for Preference-Conditioned Image Generation
- **Authors**: Wenyi Mo , Tianyu Zhang , Yalong Bai , Ligong Han , Ying Ba , Dimitris N. Metaxas
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06020)
- **Abstract**:
> Preference-conditioned image generation seeks to adapt generative models to individual users, producing outputs that reflect personal aesthetic choices beyond the given textual prompt. Despite recent progress, existing approaches either fail to capture nuanced user preferences or lack effective mechanisms to encode personalized visual signals. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to extract rich user representations and inject them into diffusion-based image generation. We train the MLLM with a preference-oriented visual question answering task to capture fine-grained semantic cues. To isolate preference-relevant features, we introduce two complementary probing tasks: inter-user discrimination to distinguish between different users, and intra-user discrimination to separate liked from disliked content. To ensure compatibility with diffusion text encoders, we design a maximum mean discrepancy-based alignment loss that bridges the modality gap while preserving multimodal structure. The resulting embeddings are used to condition the generator, enabling faithful adherence to both prompts and user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms strong baselines in both image quality and preference alignment, highlighting the effectiveness of representation extraction and alignment for personalized generation.

- **Abstract**:
> With the rapid advancement of conversational and diffusion-based AI, there is a growing adoption of AI in educational services, ranging from grading and assessment tools to personalized learning systems that provide targeted support for students. However, this adaptability has yet to fully extend to the domain of children's speech, where existing models often fail due to their reliance on datasets designed for clear, articulate adult speech. Children, particularly those in early developmental stages or with speech and language pathologies, present unique challenges that current AI models and datasets are ill-equipped to handle. To address this, we introduce KidSpeak, a multi-task speech-enhanced Foundation Model capable of both generative and discriminative tasks specifically tailored to children's speech patterns. Our framework employs a two-stage training process that incorporates phonetic knowledge into the speech encoder, achieving an average accuracy of 87% across four separate tasks. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of scalable human annotation and existing speech alignment tools, we propose the Flexible and Automatic Speech Aligner (FASA) and leverage the method to construct high quality datasets for training and evaluation. This novel alignment tool significantly improves the quality of aligned children's speech from noisy data, enhancing data quality by 13.6x compared to human annotations, as demonstrated on the CHILDES dataset. To the best of our knowledge, KidSpeak and FASA represent the first comprehensive solution designed for speech and language therapy in children, offering both a multi-purpose speech LLM and a robust alignment tool.

## 116. FlockVote: LLM-Empowered Agent-Based Modeling for Simulating U.S. Presidential Elections
- **Authors**: Lingfeng Zhou , Yi Xu , Zhenyu Wang , Dequan Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05982](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05982)
- **Abstract**:
> Modeling complex human behavior, such as voter decisions in national elections, is a long-standing challenge for computational social science. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) are limited by oversimplified rules, while large-scale statistical models often lack interpretability. We introduce FlockVote, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a "computational laboratory" of LLM agents for political simulation. Each agent is instantiated with a high-fidelity demographic profile and dynamic contextual information (e.g. candidate policies), enabling it to perform nuanced, generative reasoning to simulate a voting decision. We deploy this framework as a testbed on the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, focusing on seven key swing states. Our simulation's macro-level results successfully replicate the real-world outcome, demonstrating the high fidelity of our "virtual society". The primary contribution is not only the prediction, but also the framework's utility as an interpretable research tool. FlockVote moves beyond black-box outputs, allowing researchers to probe agent-level rationale and analyze the stability and sensitivity of LLM-driven social simulations.
