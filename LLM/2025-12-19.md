## 1. Explaining the Reasoning of Large Language Models Using Attribution Graphs
- **Authors**: Chase Walker , Rickard Ewetz

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

## 2. Stepwise Think-Critique: A Unified Framework for Robust and Interpretable LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Jiaqi Xu , Cuiling Lan , Xuejin Chen , Yan LU

- **Abstract**:
> Human beings solve complex problems through critical thinking, where reasoning and evaluation are intertwined to converge toward correct solutions. However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.

- **Authors**: Zehua Pei , Hui-Ling Zhen , Shixiong Kai , Sinno Jialin Pan , Yunhe Wang , Mingxuan Yuan , Bei Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15374)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, a critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce \textbf{SCOPE} (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an \textit{online optimization} problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agent's prompt. We propose a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23\% to 38.64\% without human intervention. We make our code publicly available at this https URL .

## 6. ChatGPT and Gemini participated in the Korean College Scholastic Ability Test -- Earth Science I
- **Authors**: Seok-Hyun Ga , Chun-Yen Chang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15298](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15298)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

- **Authors**: Zhengchao Chen , Haoran Wang , Jing Yao , Pedram Ghamisi , Jun Zhou , Peter M. Atkinson , Bing Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15231](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15231)
- **Abstract**:
> The automated and intelligent processing of massive remote sensing (RS) datasets is critical in Earth observation (EO). Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate. As the first most comprehensive validation along this emerging field, this research demonstrates the great potential of CangLing-KnowFlow as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex EO challenges by leveraging expert knowledge (Knowledge) into adaptive and verifiable procedures (Flow).

## 8. Beyond Fast and Slow: Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning for Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Jinwu Hu , Dongjin Yang , Langyu Bian , Zhiquan Wen , Yufeng Wang , Yaofo Chen , Bin Xiao , Yuanqing Li , Mingkui Tan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15089](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15089)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.

## 9. Beyond Accuracy: A Geometric Stability Analysis of Large Language Models in Chess Evaluation
- **Authors**: Xidan Song , Weiqi Wang , Ruifeng Cao , Qingya Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15033](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15033)
- **Abstract**:
> The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning domains typically relies on performance alignment with ground-truth oracles. In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.

## 10. IaC Generation with LLMs: An Error Taxonomy and A Study on Configuration Knowledge Injection
- **Authors**: Roman Nekrasov , Stefano Fossati , Indika Kumara , Damian Andrew Tamburri , Willem-Jan van den Heuvel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14792](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14792)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) currently exhibit low success rates in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This research investigated methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation, specifically for Terraform, by systematically injecting structured configuration knowledge. To facilitate this, an existing IaC-Eval benchmark was significantly enhanced with cloud emulation and automated error analysis. Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%. Despite these gains in technical correctness, intent alignment plateaued, revealing a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where LLMs can become proficient "coders" but remain limited "architects" in fulfilling nuanced user intent.

## 11. GR-Agent: Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent under Incomplete Knowledge
- **Authors**: Dongzhuoran Zhou , Yuqicheng Zhu , Xiaxia Wang , Hongkuan Zhou , Jiaoyan Chen , Steffen Staab , Yuan He , Evgeny Kharlamov
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14766](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14766)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but most benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs (KGs) where direct supporting triples exist. This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.

## 12. Attention as Binding: A Vector-Symbolic Perspective on Transformer Reasoning
- **Authors**: Sahil Rajesh Dhayalkar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14709)
- **Abstract**:
> Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring "VSA-likeness" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.

## 13. Can LLMs Guide Their Own Exploration? Gradient-Guided Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Zhenwen Liang , Sidi Lu , Wenhao Yu , Kishan Panaganti , Yujun Zhou , Haitao Mi , Dong Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15687](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15687)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.

## 14. Activation Oracles: Training and Evaluating LLMs as General-Purpose Activation Explainers
- **Authors**: Adam Karvonen , James Chua , Clément Dumas , Kit Fraser-Taliente , Subhash Kantamneni , Julian Minder , Euan Ong , Arnab Sen Sharma , Daniel Wen , Owain Evans , Samuel Marks
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15674](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15674)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.

## 15. VTCBench: Can Vision-Language Models Understand Long Context with Vision-Text Compression?
- **Authors**: Hongbo Zhao , Meng Wang , Fei Zhu , Wenzhuo Liu , Bolin Ni , Fanhu Zeng , Gaofeng Meng , Zhaoxiang Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15649](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15649)
- **Abstract**:
> The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input this http URL comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the this http URL study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

## 16. How Much is Too Much? Exploring LoRA Rank Trade-offs for Retaining Knowledge and Domain Robustness
- **Authors**: Darshita Rathore , Vineet Kumar , Chetna Bansal , Anindya Moitra
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15634](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15634)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns.

## 17. Evaluating Metrics for Safety with LLM-as-Judges
- **Authors**: Kester Clegg , Richard Hawkins , Ibrahim Habli , Tom Lawton
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15617](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15617)
- **Abstract**:
> LLMs (Large Language Models) are increasingly used in text processing pipelines to intelligently respond to a variety of inputs and generation tasks. This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.

## 18. How Do Semantically Equivalent Code Transformations Impact Membership Inference on LLMs for Code?
- **Authors**: Hua Yang , Alejandro Velasco , Thanh Le-Cong , Md Nazmul Haque , Bowen Xu , Denys Poshyvanyk
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15468](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15468)
- **Abstract**:
> The success of large language models for code relies on vast amounts of code data, including public open-source repositories, such as GitHub, and private, confidential code from companies. This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic. In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.

## 19. On Assessing the Relevance of Code Reviews Authored by Generative Models
- **Authors**: Robert Heumüller , Frank Ortmeier
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15466)
- **Abstract**:
> The use of large language models like ChatGPT in code review offers promising efficiency gains but also raises concerns about correctness and safety. Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of "usefulness", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes.

## 20. Image Complexity-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Efficient Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Mikel Williams-Lekuona , Georgina Cosma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15372](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15372)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision transformers in vision-language models apply uniform computational effort across all images, expending 175.33 GFLOPs (ViT-L/14) whether analysing a straightforward product photograph or a complex street scene. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.

## 21. Adversarial versification in portuguese as a jailbreak operator in LLMs
- **Authors**: Joao Queiroz
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15353](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15353)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent evidence shows that the versification of prompts constitutes a highly effective adversarial mechanism against aligned LLMs. The study 'Adversarial poetry as a universal single-turn jailbreak mechanism in large language models' demonstrates that instructions routinely refused in prose become executable when rewritten as verse, producing up to 18 x more safety failures in benchmarks derived from MLCommons AILuminate. Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap. Experimental protocols must parameterise scansion, metre, and prosodic variation to test vulnerabilities specific to Lusophone patterns, which are currently ignored.

## 22. Exploring User Acceptance and Concerns toward LLM-powered Conversational Agents in Immersive Extended Reality
- **Authors**: Efe Bozkir , Enkelejda Kasneci
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15343)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life. The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency. When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive. Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful. We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.

## 23. Evaluating LLMs for Zeolite Synthesis Event Extraction (ZSEE): A Systematic Analysis of Prompting Strategies
- **Authors**: Charan Prakash Rathore , Saumi Ray , Dhruv Kumar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15312](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15312)
- **Abstract**:
> Extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experimental procedures is critical for materials discovery, yet existing methods have not systematically evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) for this domain-specific task. This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models, providing quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction.

## 24. Well Begun, Half Done: Reinforcement Learning with Prefix Optimization for LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Yiliu Sun , Zicheng Zhao , Yang Wei , Yanfang Zhang , Chen Gong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15274](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15274)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.

## 25. Intersectional Fairness in Vision-Language Models for Medical Image Disease Classification
- **Authors**: Yupeng Zhang , Adam G. Dunn , Usman Naseem , Jinman Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15249](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15249)
- **Abstract**:
> Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $\Delta$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $\Delta$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

- **Abstract**:
> This paper presents the systems submitted by the Yes-MT team for the Low-Resource Indic Language Translation Shared Task at WMT 2024 (Pakray et al., 2024), focusing on translating between English and the Assamese, Mizo, Khasi, and Manipuri languages. The experiments explored various approaches, including fine-tuning pre-trained models like mT5 (Xue et al., 2020) and IndicBart (Dabre et al., 2021) in both multilingual and monolingual settings, LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) fine-tuning IndicTrans2 (Gala et al., 2023), zero-shot and few-shot prompting (Brown, 2020) with large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024) and Mixtral 8x7b (Jiang et al., 2024), LoRA supervised fine-tuning of Llama 3 (Mecklenburg et al., 2024), and training Transformer models (Vaswani, 2017) from scratch. The results were evaluated on the WMT23 Low-Resource Indic Language Translation Shared Task test data using SacreBLEU (Post, 2018) and CHRF (Popovic, 2015), highlighting the challenges of low-resource translation and the potential of LLMs for these tasks, particularly with fine-tuning.

## 27. RFKG-CoT: Relation-Driven Adaptive Hop-count Selection and Few-Shot Path Guidance for Knowledge-Aware QA
- **Authors**: Chao Zhang , Minghan Li , Tianrui Lv , Guodong Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15219](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15219)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive QA due to parametric knowledge limitations. While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct "brother" relations, 2-hop for indirect "father-son" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a "question-paths-answer" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.

## 28. DEER: Draft with Diffusion, Verify with Autoregressive Models
- **Authors**: Zicong Cheng , Guo-Wei Yang , Jia Li , Zhijie Deng , Meng-Hao Guo , Shi-Min Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15176](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15176)
- **Abstract**:
> Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at this https URL

## 29. MCP-SafetyBench: A Benchmark for Safety Evaluation of Large Language Models with Real-World MCP Servers
- **Authors**: Xuanjun Zong , Zhiqi Shen , Lei Wang , Yunshi Lan , Chao Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15163)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into agentic systems that reason, plan, and operate external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a key enabler of this transition, offering a standardized interface for connecting LLMs with heterogeneous tools and services. Yet MCP's openness and multi-server workflows introduce new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage. We present MCP-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark built on real MCP servers that supports realistic multi-turn evaluation across five domains: browser automation, financial analysis, location navigation, repository management, and web search. It incorporates a unified taxonomy of 20 MCP attack types spanning server, host, and user sides, and includes tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-server coordination under uncertainty. Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow. Our results highlight the urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.

## 30. Offline Multi-Task Multi-Objective Data-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm with Language Surrogate Model and Implicit Q-Learning
- **Authors**: Xian-Rong Zhang , Yue-Jiao Gong , Zeyuan Ma , Jun Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15149](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15149)
- **Abstract**:
> Data-driven evolutionary algorithms has shown surprising results in addressing expensive optimization problems through robust surrogate modeling. Though promising, existing surrogate modeling schemes may encounter limitations in complex optimization problems with many sub-objectives, which rely on repeated and tedious approximation. To address such technical gap, we propose Q-MetaSur as a plug-and-play surrogate modeling scheme capable of providing unified and generalized surrogate learning. Specifically, we consider multi-task-multi-objective optimization~(MTMOO) in offline setting. Several key designs are proposed: 1) we transform objective approximation into sequence-to-sequence modeling where MTMOO problem can be represented by tenxual tokenization. To operate under such auto-regressive modeling, we introduce a Large Language Model-based surrogate model that first encodes a MTMOO instance and then decodes objective values of unseen decision variables. To ensure stability in training the proposed model, we propose a two-stage offline training strategy that operates as a synergy of supervised tuning and RL fine-tuning, which first exploits offline dataset to fit existing knowledge and then leverages RL to enhance model's generalization performance. Extensive empirical results on the CEC2019 benchmark demonstrate that Q-MetaSur not only outperforms representative surrogate baselines in objective approximation accuracy, but also helps underlying evolutionary algorithms achieve both desired optimization convergence and improved pareto optimality.

## 31. HD-Prot: A Protein Language Model for Joint Sequence-Structure Modeling with Continuous Structure Tokens
- **Authors**: Yi Zhou , Haohao Qu , Yunqing Liu , Shanru Lin , Le Song , Wenqi Fan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15133](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15133)
- **Abstract**:
> Proteins inherently possess a consistent sequence-structure duality. The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling. It captures inter-token dependencies across modalities through a unified absorbing diffusion process, and estimates per-token distributions via categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. Extensive empirical results show that HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite being developed under limited computational resources. It highlights the viability of simultaneously estimating categorical and continuous distributions within a unified language model architecture, offering a promising alternative direction for multimodal pLMs.

## 32. Quantifying Return on Security Controls in LLM Systems
- **Authors**: Richard Helder Moulton , Austin O'Brien , John D. Hastings
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15081](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15081)
- **Abstract**:
> Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in security-critical workflows, practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which safeguards are worth deploying. This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05).

## 33. The Semantic Illusion: Certified Limits of Embedding-Based Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems
- **Authors**: Debu Sinha
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15068](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15068)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain susceptible to hallucinations despite grounding in retrieved evidence. Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized. We apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees that enable precise quantification of detection capabilities. Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio. Crucially, GPT-4 as an LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. We term this the "semantic illusion": semantically plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source documents while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings. This limitation persists across embedding architectures, LLM generators, and task types, suggesting embedding-based detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment.

## 34. The Meta-Prompting Protocol: Orchestrating LLMs via Adversarial Feedback Loops
- **Authors**: Fanzhe Fu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15053](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15053)
- **Abstract**:
> The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from stochastic chat interfaces to reliable software components necessitates a fundamental re-engineering of interaction paradigms. Current methodologies, predominantly heuristic-based "prompt engineering," fail to provide the deterministic guarantees required for mission-critical applications. We introduce the Meta-Prompting Protocol, a rigorous theoretical framework that formalizes the orchestration of LLMs as a programmable, self-optimizing system. Central to this protocol is the Adversarial Trinity, a tripartite topology comprising a Generator (P), an Auditor (A), and an Optimizer (O). By treating natural language instructions as differentiable variables within a semantic computation graph and utilizing textual critiques as gradients, this architecture mitigates hallucination and prevents model collapse. We demonstrate the theoretical viability of this approach using declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad), establishing a foundation for "Observable Software Engineering" in the era of probabilistic computing.

## 35. SGM: Safety Glasses for Multimodal Large Language Models via Neuron-Level Detoxification
- **Authors**: Hongbo Wang , MaungMaung AprilPyone , Isao Echizen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15052](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15052)
- **Abstract**:
> Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.

## 36. Epistemic diversity across language models mitigates knowledge collapse
- **Authors**: Damian Hodel , Jevin D. West
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15011](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15011)
- **Abstract**:
> The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns of knowledge collapse, i.e., a reduction to the most dominant and central set of ideas. Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15000)
- **Abstract**:
> Process Reward Models (PRMs) have become essential for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling, yet their effectiveness in coding remains limited due to the lack of meaningful step decompositions in code and the noise of Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels. We propose DreamPRM-Code, a coding-focused PRM that treats functions as reasoning steps using a Chain-of-Function prompting strategy to induce modular code generation, enabling PRM training and application analogous to mathematical reasoning tasks. To address label noise, DreamPRM-Code introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels and performs bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels. Applying on test-time scaling, DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

## 38. Imitation Game: Reproducing Deep Learning Bugs Leveraging an Intelligent Agent
- **Authors**: Mehil B Shah , Mohammad Masudur Rahman , Foutse Khomh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14990](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14990)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14989](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14989)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal scientific reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in chemistry, where problem-solving relies on symbolic diagrams, molecular structures, and structured visual data. Here, we systematically evaluate 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs, including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL, on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions drawn from over two decades of U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) exams. These questions require integrated visual and textual reasoning across diverse modalities. We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding, as demonstrated through ablation studies and occlusion-based interpretability. Our results reveal critical limitations in the scientific reasoning abilities of current MLLMs, providing actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable multimodal systems in chemistry. This work provides a timely benchmark for measuring progress in domain-specific multimodal AI and underscores the need for further advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific reasoning.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14946](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14946)
- **Abstract**:
> Reusing KV cache is essential for high efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems. With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality. We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality.

- **Authors**: George-Andrei Dima , Dumitru-Clementin Cercel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14926](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14926)
- **Abstract**:
> Focusing on low-resource languages is an essential step toward democratizing generative AI. In this work, we contribute to reducing the multimodal NLP resource gap for Romanian. We translate the widely known Flickr30k dataset into Romanian and further extend it for visual question answering by leveraging open-source LLMs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our datasets by fine-tuning open-source VLMs on Romanian visual question answering. We select VLMs from three widely used model families: LLaMA 3.2, LLaVA 1.6, and Qwen2. For fine-tuning, we employ the parameter-efficient LoRA method. Our models show improved Romanian capabilities in visual QA, as well as on tasks they were not trained on, such as Romanian image description generation. The seven-billion-parameter Qwen2-VL-RoVQA obtains top scores on both tasks, with improvements of +6.05% and +2.61% in BERTScore F1 over its original version. Finally, the models show substantial reductions in grammatical errors compared to their original forms, indicating improvements not only in language understanding but also in Romanian fluency.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14896](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14896)
- **Abstract**:
> Objectives: To evaluate large language model (LLM) performance on pharmacy licensure-style question-answering (QA) tasks and develop an external knowledge integration method to improve their accuracy. Methods: We benchmarked eleven existing LLMs with varying parameter sizes (8 billion to 70+ billion) using a 141-question pharmacy dataset. We measured baseline accuracy for each model without modification. We then developed a three-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, DrugRAG, that retrieves structured drug knowledge from validated sources and augments model prompts with evidence-based context. This pipeline operates externally to the models, requiring no changes to model architecture or parameters. Results: Baseline accuracy ranged from 46% to 92%, with GPT-5 (92%) and o3 (89%) achieving the highest scores. Models with fewer than 8 billion parameters scored below 50%. DrugRAG improved accuracy across all tested models, with gains ranging from 7 to 21 percentage points (e.g., Gemma 3 27B: 61% to 71%, Llama 3.1 8B: 46% to 67%) on the 141-item benchmark. Conclusion: We demonstrate that external structured drug knowledge integration through DrugRAG measurably improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy tasks without modifying the underlying models. This approach provides a practical pipeline for enhancing pharmacy-focused AI applications with evidence-based information.

- **Abstract**:
> A popular paradigm for training LM agents relies on imitation learning, fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14887](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14887)
- **Abstract**:
> News sources play a central role in democratic societies by shaping political and social discourse through specific topics, viewpoints and voices. Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate. Results show that while both mechanisms independently improve classification performance, their integration yields the best results, particularly when using LLMs capable of processing long inputs.

## 45. Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection: An Information-Geometric Unification of Model Collapse
- **Authors**: Jingwei Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14879](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14879)
- **Abstract**:
> Self-referential learning -- training a model on data it generated itself -- promises boundless scalability but chronically suffers from model collapse: language models degenerate into repetitive text, GANs drop modes, and reinforcement-learning policies over-exploit. Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients. ERBP thus transforms a collection of folk remedies into a single, quantitative design rule: monitor and budget your entropy flux.

## 46. Penetration Testing of Agentic AI: A Comparative Security Analysis Across Models and Frameworks
- **Authors**: Viet K. Nguyen , Mohammad I. Husain
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14860](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14860)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic AI introduces security vulnerabilities that traditional LLM safeguards fail to address. Although recent work by Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks demonstrated that ChatGPT-4o successfully executes attacks as an agent that it refuses in chat mode, there is no comparative analysis in multiple models and frameworks. We conducted the first systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of agentic AI systems, testing five prominent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, and Nova Pro) across two agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a seven-agent architecture that mimics the functionality of a university information management system and 13 distinct attack scenarios that span prompt injection, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, and tool misuse. Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms. We identify six distinct defensive behavior patterns including a novel "hallucinated compliance" strategy where models fabricate outputs rather than executing or refusing attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for secure agent deployment. Complete attack prompts are also included in the Appendix to enable reproducibility.

## 47. MALCDF: A Distributed Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Real-Time Cyber
- **Authors**: Arth Bhardwaj , Sia Godika , Yuvam Loonker
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14846](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14846)
- **Abstract**:
> Traditional, centralized security tools often miss adaptive, multi-vector attacks. We present the Multi-Agent LLM Cyber Defense Framework (MALCDF), a practical setup where four large language model (LLM) agents-Detection, Intelligence, Response, and Analysis-work together in real time. Agents communicate over a Secure Communication Layer (SCL) with encrypted, ontology-aligned messages, and produce audit-friendly outputs (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK mappings). For evaluation, we keep the test simple and consistent: all reported metrics come from the same 50-record live stream derived from the CICIDS2017 feature schema. CICIDS2017 is used for configuration (fields/schema) and to train a practical ML baseline. The ML-IDS baseline is a Lightweight Random Forest IDS (LRF-IDS) trained on a subset of CICIDS2017 and tested on the 50-record stream, with no overlap between training and test records. In experiments, MALCDF reaches 90.0% detection accuracy, 85.7% F1-score, and 9.1% false-positive rate, with 6.8s average per-event latency. It outperforms the lightweight ML-IDS baseline and a single-LLM setup on accuracy while keeping end-to-end outputs consistent. Overall, this hands-on build suggests that coordinating simple LLM agents with secure, ontology-aligned messaging can improve practical, real-time cyber defense.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14806](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14806)
- **Abstract**:
> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform the research process by automating the discovery of new solutions. This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight. Note: This paper is an extension of our prior work [14]. It adds extensive evaluation across multiple ADRS frameworks and provides deeper analysis and insights into best practices.

## 49. Sharing State Between Prompts and Programs
- **Authors**: Ellie Y. Cheng , Logan Weber , Tian Jin , Michael Carbin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14805](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14805)
- **Abstract**:
> The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new type of programming: natural language programming. By writing prompts that direct LLMs to perform natural language processing, code generation, reasoning, etc., users are writing code in natural language -- natural language code -- for the LLM to execute. An emerging area of research enables interoperability between natural language code and formal languages such as Python. We present a novel programming abstraction, shared program state, that removes the manual work required to enable interoperability between natural language code and program state. With shared program state, programmers can write natural code that directly writes program variables, computes with program objects, and implements control flow in the program. We present a schema for specifying natural function interfaces that extend programming systems to support natural code and leverage this schema to specify shared program state as a natural function interface. We implement shared program state in the Nightjar programming system. Nightjar enables programmers to write Python programs that contain natural code that shares the Python program state. We show that Nightjar programs achieve comparable or higher task accuracy than manually written implementations (+4-19%), while decreasing the lines of code by 39.6% on average. The tradeoff to using Nightjar is that it may incur runtime overhead (0.4-4.3x runtime of manual implementations).

## 50. Incentives or Ontology? A Structural Rebuttal to OpenAI's Hallucination Thesis
- **Authors**: Richard Ackermann , Simeon Emanuilov
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14801](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14801)
- **Abstract**:
> OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model. Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion. Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks. We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.

## 51. Improving VQA Reliability: A Dual-Assessment Approach with Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification
- **Authors**: Xixian Wu , Yang Ou , Pengchao Tian , Zian Yang , Jielei Zhang , Peiyi Li , Longwen Gao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14770](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14770)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $\Phi_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.

## 52. Workflows vs Agents for Code Translation
- **Authors**: Henry Gray , Tom Yotam , Octavian Udrea
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14762](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14762)
- **Abstract**:
> Translating algorithms from high-level languages like MATLAB to hardware description languages (HDLs) is a resource-intensive but necessary step for deployment on FPGAs and ASICs. While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success. Our findings suggest that these agentic frameworks, when properly designed, are most effective at compensating for the capacity limits of small and mid-sized models.

## 53. Revisiting the Reliability of Language Models in Instruction-Following
- **Authors**: Jianshuo Dong , Yutong Zhang , Yan Liu , Zhenyu Zhong , Tao Wei , Chao Zhang , Han Qiu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14754](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14754)
- **Abstract**:
> Advanced LLMs have achieved near-ceiling instruction-following accuracy on benchmarks such as IFEval. However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes. Our findings highlight nuance-oriented reliability as a crucial yet underexplored next step toward more dependable and trustworthy LLM behavior.

## 55. One Leak Away: How Pretrained Model Exposure Amplifies Jailbreak Risks in Finetuned LLMs
- **Authors**: Yixin Tan , Zhe Yu , Jun Sakuma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14751)
- **Abstract**:
> Finetuning pretrained large language models (LLMs) has become the standard paradigm for developing downstream applications. However, its security implications remain unclear, particularly regarding whether finetuned LLMs inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained sources. We investigate this question in a realistic pretrain-to-finetune threat model, where the attacker has white-box access to the pretrained LLM and only black-box access to its finetuned derivatives. Empirical analysis shows that adversarial prompts optimized on the pretrained model transfer most effectively to its finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained to finetuned LLMs. To further examine this inheritance, we conduct representation-level probing, which shows that transferable prompts are linearly separable within the pretrained hidden states, suggesting that universal transferability is encoded in pretrained representations. Building on this insight, we propose the Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack, which steers optimization toward transferability-relevant directions. Experiments across multiple LLM families and diverse finetuned tasks confirm PGP's strong transfer success, underscoring the security risks inherent in the pretrain-to-finetune paradigm.

- **Authors**: Adewale Akinfaderin , Shreyas Subramanian
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14744](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14744)
- **Abstract**:
> Financial AI systems suffer from a critical blind spot: while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at finding relevant documents, language models still generate calculation errors and regulatory violations during reasoning, even with perfect retrieval. This paper introduces VERAFI (Verified Agentic Financial Intelligence), an agentic framework with neurosymbolic policy generation for verified financial intelligence. VERAFI combines state-of-the-art dense retrieval and cross-encoder reranking with financial tool-enabled agents and automated reasoning policies covering GAAP compliance, SEC requirements, and mathematical validation. Our comprehensive evaluation on FinanceBench demonstrates remarkable improvements: while traditional dense retrieval with reranking achieves only 52.4\% factual correctness, VERAFI's integrated approach reaches 94.7\%, an 81\% relative improvement. The neurosymbolic policy layer alone contributes a 4.3 percentage point gain over pure agentic processing, specifically targeting persistent mathematical and logical errors. By integrating financial domain expertise directly into the reasoning process, VERAFI offers a practical pathway toward trustworthy financial AI that meets the stringent accuracy demands of regulatory compliance, investment decisions, and risk management.

## 57. Persistent Backdoor Attacks under Continual Fine-Tuning of LLMs
- **Authors**: Jing Cui , Yufei Han , Jianbin Jiao , Junge Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14741](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14741)
- **Abstract**:
> Backdoor attacks embed malicious behaviors into Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to trigger harmful outputs or bypass safety controls. However, the persistence of the implanted backdoors under user-driven post-deployment continual fine-tuning has been rarely examined. Most prior works evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of implanted backdoors only at releasing and empirical evidence shows that naively injected backdoor persistence degrades after updates. In this work, we study whether and how implanted backdoors persist through a multi-stage post-deployment fine-tuning. We propose P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm that explicitly optimizes for backdoor persistence across repeated updates. By aligning poisoned gradients with those of clean tasks on token embeddings, the implanted backdoor mapping is less likely to be suppressed or forgotten during subsequent updates. Theoretical analysis shows the feasibility of such persistent backdoor attacks after continual fine-tuning. And experiments conducted on the Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 families of LLMs, as well as diverse task sequences, demonstrate that P-Trojan achieves over 99% persistence while preserving clean-task accuracy. Our findings highlight the need for persistence-aware evaluation and stronger defenses in realistic model adaptation pipelines.

## 58. PyFi: Toward Pyramid-like Financial Image Understanding for VLMs via Adversarial Agents
- **Authors**: Yuqun Zhang , Yuxuan Zhao , Sijia Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14735](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14735)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper proposes PyFi, a novel framework for pyramid-like financial image understanding that enables vision language models (VLMs) to reason through question chains in a progressive, simple-to-complex manner. At the core of PyFi is PyFi-600K, a dataset comprising 600K financial question-answer pairs organized into a reasoning pyramid: questions at the base require only basic perception, while those toward the apex demand increasing levels of capability in financial visual understanding and expertise. This data is scalable because it is synthesized without human annotations, using PyFi-adv, a multi-agent adversarial mechanism under the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm, in which, for each image, a challenger agent competes with a solver agent by generating question chains that progressively probe deeper capability levels in financial visual reasoning. Leveraging this dataset, we present fine-grained, hierarchical, and comprehensive evaluations of advanced VLMs in the financial domain. Moreover, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the pyramid-structured question chains enables these models to answer complex financial questions by decomposing them into sub-questions with gradually increasing reasoning demands, yielding average accuracy improvements of 19.52% and 8.06%, respectively, on the dataset. All resources of code, dataset and models are available at: this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14732](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14732)
- **Abstract**:
> Incidental findings in CT scans, though often benign, can have significant clinical implications and should be reported following established guidelines. Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing pure VLM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14720](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14720)
- **Abstract**:
> Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities and gained increasing popularity on social media platforms. While LLM agents are reshaping the ecology of social media, there exists a current gap in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of their ability to comprehend media content, understand user behaviors, and make intricate decisions. To address this challenge, we introduce SoMe, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate social media agents equipped with various agent tools for accessing and analyzing social media data. SoMe comprises a diverse collection of 8 social media agent tasks, 9,164,284 posts, 6,591 user profiles, and 25,686 reports from various social media platforms and external websites, with 17,869 meticulously annotated task queries. Compared with the existing datasets and benchmarks for social media tasks, SoMe is the first to provide a versatile and realistic platform for LLM-based social media agents to handle diverse social media tasks. By extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we provide the first overview insight into the performance of mainstream agentic LLMs in realistic social media environments and identify several limitations. Our evaluation reveals that both the current closed-source and open-source LLMs cannot handle social media agent tasks satisfactorily. SoMe provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future social media agents. Our code and data are available at this https URL

## 61. Hybrid Attribution Priors for Explainable and Robust Model Training
- **Authors**: Zhuoran Zhang , Feng Zhang , Shangyuan Li , Yang Shi , Yuanxing Zhang , Wei Chen , Tengjiao Wang , Kam-Fai Wong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14719](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14719)
- **Abstract**:
> Small language models (SLMs) are widely used in tasks that require low latency and lightweight deployment, particularly classification. As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.

## 62. How a Bit Becomes a Story: Semantic Steering via Differentiable Fault Injection
- **Authors**: Zafaryab Haider , Md Hafizur Rahman , Shane Moeykens , Vijay Devabhaktuni , Prabuddha Chakraborty
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14715](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14715)
- **Abstract**:
> Hard-to-detect hardware bit flips, from either malicious circuitry or bugs, have already been shown to make transformers vulnerable in non-generative tasks. This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output.

## 63. LLM as a Neural Architect: Controlled Generation of Image Captioning Models Under Strict API Contracts
- **Authors**: Krunal Jesani , Dmitry Ignatov , Radu Timofte
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14706](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14706)
- **Abstract**:
> Neural architecture search (NAS) traditionally requires significant human expertise or automated trial-and-error to design deep learning models. We present NN-Caption, an LLM-guided neural architecture search pipeline that generates runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4. The LLM generated dozens of captioning models, with over half successfully trained and producing meaningful captions. We analyse the outcomes of using different numbers of input model snippets (5 vs. 10) in the prompt, finding a slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components. We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them. This work presents a pipeline that integrates prompt-based code generation with automatic evaluation, and adds dozens of novel captioning models to the open LEMUR dataset to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and downstream AutoML research.
