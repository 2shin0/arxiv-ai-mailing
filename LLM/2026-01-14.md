- **Abstract**:
> As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in digital platforms and decision-making systems, concerns about their political biases have grown. While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.

- **Abstract**:
> Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are essential for evaluating corporate sustainability and ethical performance. However, professional ESG analysis is hindered by data fragmentation across unstructured sources, and existing large language models (LLMs) often struggle with the complex, multi-step workflows required for rigorous auditing. To address these limitations, we introduce ESGAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent system empowered by a specialized toolset, including retrieval augmentation, web search and domain-specific functions, to generate in-depth ESG analysis. Complementing this agentic system, we present a comprehensive three-level benchmark derived from 310 corporate sustainability reports, designed to evaluate capabilities ranging from atomic common-sense questions to the generation of integrated, in-depth analysis. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ESGAgent outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with an average accuracy of 84.15% on atomic question-answering tasks, and excels in professional report generation by integrating rich charts and verifiable references. These findings confirm the diagnostic value of our benchmark, establishing it as a vital testbed for assessing general and advanced agentic capabilities in high-stakes vertical domains.

## 3. Why AI Alignment Failure Is Structural: Learned Human Interaction Structures and AGI as an Endogenous Evolutionary Shock
- **Authors**: Didier Sornette , Sandro Claudio Lera , Ke Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08673](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08673)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent reports of large language models (LLMs) exhibiting behaviors such as deception, threats, or blackmail are often interpreted as evidence of alignment failure or emergent malign agency. We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.

## 4. Prism: Towards Lowering User Cognitive Load in LLMs via Complex Intent Understanding
- **Authors**: Zenghua Liao , Jinzhi Liao , Xiang Zhao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08653](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08653)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%. All data and code are released.

## 5. Resisting Manipulative Bots in Memecoin Copy Trading: A Multi-Agent Approach with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- **Authors**: Yichen Luo , Yebo Feng , Jiahua Xu , Yang Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08641](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08641)
- **Abstract**:
> The launch of \$Trump coin ignited a wave in meme coin investment. Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data. To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \$500,000 across these projects.

- **Authors**: Zhenlong Dai , Zhuoluo Zhao , Hengning Wang , Xiu Tang , Sai Wu , Chang Yao , Zhipeng Gao , Jingyuan Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08545)
- **Abstract**:
> With the development of large language models (LLMs) in the field of programming, intelligent programming coaching systems have gained widespread attention. However, most research focuses on repairing the buggy code of programming learners without providing the underlying causes of the bugs. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task, namely \textbf{LPR} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{P}rogram \textbf{R}epair). We then propose a novel and effective framework, \textbf{\textsc{\MethodName{}}} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{S}olution \textbf{G}enerator), to enhance program repair while offering the bug descriptions for the buggy code. In the first stage, we utilize a repair solution retrieval framework to construct a solution retrieval database and then employ an edit-driven code retrieval approach to retrieve valuable solutions, guiding LLMs in identifying and fixing the bugs in buggy code. In the second stage, we propose a solution-guided program repair method, which fixes the code and provides explanations under the guidance of retrieval solutions. Moreover, we propose an Iterative Retrieval Enhancement method that utilizes evaluation results of the generated code to iteratively optimize the retrieval direction and explore more suitable repair strategies, improving performance in practical programming coaching scenarios. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our framework for the newly proposed LPR task.

## 7. Sketch-Based Facade Renovation With Generative AI: A Streamlined Framework for Bypassing As-Built Modelling in Industrial Adaptive Reuse
- **Authors**: Warissara Booranamaitree , Xusheng Du , Yushu Cai , Zhengyang Wang , Ye Zhang , Haoran Xie
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08531](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08531)
- **Abstract**:
> Facade renovation offers a more sustainable alternative to full demolition, yet producing design proposals that preserve existing structures while expressing new intent remains challenging. Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity.

## 8. What If TSF: A Benchmark for Reframing Forecasting as Scenario-Guided Multimodal Forecasting
- **Authors**: Jinkwan Jang , Hyunbin Jin , Hyungjin Park , Kyubyung Chae , Taesup Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08509)
- **Abstract**:
> Time series forecasting is critical to real-world decision making, yet most existing approaches remain unimodal and rely on extrapolating historical patterns. While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential for multimodal forecasting, existing benchmarks largely provide retrospective or misaligned raw context, making it unclear whether such models meaningfully leverage textual inputs. In practice, human experts incorporate what-if scenarios with historical evidence, often producing distinct forecasts from the same observations under different scenarios. Inspired by this, we introduce What If TSF (WIT), a multimodal forecasting benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can condition their forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios. By providing expert-crafted plausible or counterfactual scenarios, WIT offers a rigorous testbed for scenario-guided multimodal forecasting. The benchmark is available at this https URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08475](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08475)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper incorporates the efficiency of automatic summarization and addresses the challenge of generating personalized summaries tailored to individual users' interests and requirements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SummPilot, an interaction-based customizable summarization system. SummPilot leverages a large language model to facilitate both automatic and interactive summarization. Users can engage with the system to understand document content and personalize summaries through interactive components such as semantic graphs, entity clustering, and explainable evaluation. Our demo and user studies demonstrate SummPilot's adaptability and usefulness for customizable summarization.

## 10. M3-BENCH: Process-Aware Evaluation of LLM Agents Social Behaviors in Mixed-Motive Games
- **Authors**: Sixiong Xie , Zhuofan Shi , Haiyang Shen , Gang Huang , Yun Ma , Xiang Jing
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08462](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08462)
- **Abstract**:
> As the capabilities of large language model (LLM) agents continue to advance, their advanced social behaviors, such as cooperation, deception, and collusion, call for systematic evaluation. However, existing benchmarks often emphasize a single capability dimension or rely solely on behavioral outcomes, overlooking rich process information from agents' decision reasoning and communicative interactions. To address this gap, we propose M3-Bench, a multi-stage benchmark for mixed-motive games, together with a process-aware evaluation framework that conducts synergistic analysis across three modules: BTA (Behavioral Trajectory Analysis), RPA (Reasoning Process Analysis), and CCA (Communication Content Analysis). Furthermore, we integrate the Big Five personality model and Social Exchange Theory to aggregate multi-dimensional evidence into interpretable social behavior portraits, thereby characterizing agents' personality traits and capability profiles beyond simple task scores or outcome-based metrics. Experimental results show that M3-Bench can reliably distinguish diverse social behavior competencies across models, and it reveals that some models achieve seemingly reasonable behavioral outcomes while exhibiting pronounced inconsistencies in their reasoning and communication.

## 11. Beyond Linearization: Attributed Table Graphs for Table Reasoning
- **Authors**: Yuxiang Wang , Junhao Gan , Shengxiang Gao , Shenghao Ye , Zhengyi Yang , Jianzhong Qi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08444](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08444)
- **Abstract**:
> Table reasoning, a task to answer questions by reasoning over data presented in tables, is an important topic due to the prevalence of knowledge stored in tabular formats. Recent solutions use Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. A common paradigm of such solutions linearizes tables to form plain texts that are served as input to LLMs. This paradigm has critical issues. It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the "lost-in-the-middle" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG). The ATG explicitly preserves row-column-cell structures while enabling graph-based reasoning for explainability. We further propose a Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) mechanism to rerank tabular data and mitigate the lost-in-the-middle issue. Extensive experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that TABGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 9.7% in accuracy. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

## 12. YaPO: Learnable Sparse Activation Steering Vectors for Domain Adaptation
- **Authors**: Abdelaziz Bounhar , Rania Hossam Elmohamady Elbadry , Hadi Abdine , Preslav Nakov , Michalis Vazirgiannis , Guokan Shang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08441](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08441)
- **Abstract**:
> Steering Large Language Models (LLMs) through activation interventions has emerged as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for alignment and personalization. Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a \textit{reference-free} method that learns \textit{sparse steering vectors} in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, YaPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU. Overall, our results show that YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs, with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation. The associated code and data are publicly available\footnote{ this https URL }.

## 13. Hybrid Distillation with CoT Guidance for Edge-Drone Control Code Generation
- **Authors**: Yizhan Feng , Hichem Snoussi , Yuhang Wang , Jing Teng , Abel Cherouat , Tian Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08412](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08412)
- **Abstract**:
> With large language models demonstrating significant potential in code generation tasks, their application to onboard control of resource-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has emerged as an important research direction. However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs

## 14. Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO): A Principled RL Algorithm for Generative Search LLMs
- **Authors**: Abhijnan Nath , Alireza Bagheri Garakani , Tianchen Zhou , Fan Yang , Nikhil Krishnaswamy
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08403](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08403)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models are increasingly trained via reinforcement learning for personalized recommendation tasks, but standard methods like GRPO rely on sparse, sequence-level rewards that create a credit assignment gap, obscuring which tokens drive success. This gap is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels, a reasoning pattern rarely seen during pretraining. We introduce Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO), a framework that redistributes sequence-level advantages based on tokens' marginal contributions to outcomes. Unlike value-model-based methods requiring additional computation, OSPO employs potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving the optimal policy, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models. By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance. Experiments on Amazon ESCI and H&M Fashion datasets show consistent gains over baselines, with notable test-time robustness to out-of-distribution retrievers unseen during training.

## 15. Semantic Laundering in AI Agent Architectures: Why Tool Boundaries Do Not Confer Epistemic Warrant
- **Authors**: Oleg Romanchuk , Roman Bondar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08333](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08333)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM-based agent architectures systematically conflate information transport mechanisms with epistemic justification mechanisms. We formalize this class of architectural failures as semantic laundering: a pattern where propositions with absent or weak warrant are accepted by the system as admissible by crossing architecturally trusted interfaces. We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. We introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation for this effect and show that scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating a problem that exists at the type level.

## 16. Greedy Is Enough: Sparse Action Discovery in Agentic LLMs
- **Authors**: Angshul Majumdar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08280](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08280)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern agentic systems operate in environments with extremely large action spaces, such as tool-augmented language models with thousands of available APIs or retrieval operations. Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states. We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states. Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability. Together, our results identify sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provide a theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems.

## 17. Sparsity Is Necessary: Polynomial-Time Stability for Agentic LLMs in Large Action Spaces
- **Authors**: Angshul Majumdar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08271](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08271)
- **Abstract**:
> Tool-augmented LLM systems expose a control regime that learning theory has largely ignored: sequential decision-making with a massive discrete action universe (tools, APIs, documents) in which only a small, unknown subset is relevant for any fixed task distribution. We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M. Extensions cover tuning-free, online, robust, group-sparse, and interaction-aware SAC.

## 18. T3: Benchmarking Sycophancy and Skepticism in Causal Judgment
- **Authors**: Edward Y. Chang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08258](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08258)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce T3 (Testing Trustworthy Thinking), a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLM causal judgment across Pearl's Ladder of Causality. Comprising 454 expert-curated vignettes, T3 prioritizes high-resolution failure analysis, decomposing performance into Utility (sensitivity), Safety (specificity), and Wise Refusal on underdetermined cases. By applying T3 to frontier models, we diagnose two distinct pathologies: a "Skepticism Trap" at L1 (where safety-tuned models like Claude Haiku reject 60% of valid links) and a non-monotonic Scaling Paradox at L3. In the latter, the larger GPT-5.2 underperforms GPT-4-Turbo by 55 points on ambiguous counterfactuals, driven by a collapse into paralysis (excessive hedging) rather than hallucination. Finally, we use the benchmark to validate a process-verified protocol (RCA), showing that T3 successfully captures the restoration of decisive causal judgment under structured verification.

## 19. Large Artificial Intelligence Model Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation in Non Terrestrial Networks
- **Authors**: Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim , Rosdiadee Nordin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08254](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08254)
- **Abstract**:
> Large AI Model (LAM) have been proposed to applications of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), that offer better performance with its great generalization and reduced task specific trainings. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that is guided by a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM operates as a high level coordinator that generates textual guidance that shape the reward of the DRL agent during training. The results show that the LAM-DRL outperforms the traditional DRL by 40% in nominal weather scenarios and 64% in extreme weather scenarios compared to heuristics in terms of throughput, fairness, and outage probability.

## 20. The End of Reward Engineering: How LLMs Are Redefining Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Authors**: Haoran Su , Yandong Sun , Congjia Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08237](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08237)
- **Abstract**:
> Reward engineering, the manual specification of reward functions to induce desired agent behavior, remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems. We conclude by outlining a research direction in which coordination arises from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals.

## 21. MPCI-Bench: A Benchmark for Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity Evaluation of Language Model Agents
- **Authors**: Shouju Wang , Haopeng Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08235)
- **Abstract**:
> As language-model agents evolve from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that handle personal data, evaluating their adherence to social norms becomes increasingly critical, often through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). However, existing CI benchmarks are largely text-centric and primarily emphasize negative refusal scenarios, overlooking multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information. We will open-source MPCI-Bench to facilitate future research on agentic CI.

## 22. Improving LLM Reasoning with Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Text-Attributed Graph Compression
- **Authors**: Zijun Di , Bin Lu , Huquan Kang , Luoyi Fu , Jiaxin Ding , Xiaoying Gan , Lei Zhou , Xinbing Wang , Chenghu Zhou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08187)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in Text-Attributed Graph (TAG) understanding. Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability. Extensions to 7 diverse graph-level benchmarks further consolidate HS2C's task generalizability.

- **Authors**: Daocheng Fu , Jianbiao Mei , Rong Wu , Xuemeng Yang , Jia Xu , Ding Wang , Pinlong Cai , Yong Liu , Licheng Wen , Botian Shi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08173)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid evolution of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has advanced workflow automation; however, existing research mainly targets performance upper bounds in static environments, overlooking robustness for stochastic real-world deployment. We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a "trainee" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios. Our codes are available at this https URL

## 24. ZeroDVFS: Zero-Shot LLM-Guided Core and Frequency Allocation for Embedded Platforms
- **Authors**: Mohammad Pivezhandi , Mahdi Banisharif , Abusayeed Saifullah , Ali Jannesari
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08166](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08166)
- **Abstract**:
> Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and task-to-core allocation are critical for thermal management and balancing energy and performance in embedded systems. Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor. First-decision latency is 8,300x faster than table-based profiling, enabling practical deployment in dynamic embedded systems.

## 25. Project Synapse: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework with Hybrid Memory for Autonomous Resolution of Last-Mile Delivery Disruptions
- **Authors**: Arin Gopalan Yadav , Varad Dherange , Kumar Shivam
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08156](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08156)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper introduces Project Synapse, a novel agentic framework designed for the autonomous resolution of last-mile delivery disruptions. Synapse employs a hierarchical multi-agent architecture in which a central Resolution Supervisor agent performs strategic task decomposition and delegates subtasks to specialized worker agents responsible for tactical execution. The system is orchestrated using LangGraph to manage complex and cyclical workflows. To validate the framework, a benchmark dataset of 30 complex disruption scenarios was curated from a qualitative analysis of over 6,000 real-world user reviews. System performance is evaluated using an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol with explicit bias mitigation.

## 26. Embedded AI Companion System on Edge Devices
- **Authors**: Rahul Gupta , Stephen D.H. Hsu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08128](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08128)
- **Abstract**:
> Computational resource constraints on edge devices make it difficult to develop a fully embedded AI companion system with a satisfactory user experience. AI companion and memory systems detailed in existing literature cannot be directly used in such an environment due to lack of compute resources and latency concerns. In this paper, we propose a memory paradigm that alternates between active and inactive phases: during phases of user activity, the system performs low-latency, real-time dialog using lightweight retrieval over existing memories and context; whereas during phases of user inactivity, it conducts more computationally intensive extraction, consolidation, and maintenance of memories across full conversation sessions. This design minimizes latency while maintaining long-term personalization under the tight constraints of embedded hardware. We also introduce an AI Companion benchmark designed to holistically evaluate the AI Companion across both its conversational quality and memory capabilities. In our experiments, we found that our system (using a very weak model: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct quantized int4) outperforms the equivalent raw LLM without memory across most metrics, and performs comparably to GPT-3.5 with 16k context window.

- **Authors**: Ashutosh Hathidara , Julien Yu , Vaishali Senthil , Sebastian Schreiber , Anil Babu Ankisettipalli
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08118](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08118)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as human simulators, both for evaluating conversational systems and for generating fine-tuning data. However, naive "act-as-a-user" prompting often yields verbose, unrealistic utterances, underscoring the need for principled evaluation of so-called user proxy agents. We present MIRRORBENCH, a reproducible, extensible benchmarking framework that evaluates user proxies solely on their ability to produce human-like user utterances across diverse conversational tasks, explicitly decoupled from downstream task success. MIRRORBENCH features a modular execution engine with typed interfaces, metadata-driven registries, multi-backend support, caching, and robust observability. The system supports pluggable user proxies, datasets, tasks, and metrics, enabling researchers to evaluate arbitrary simulators under a uniform, variance-aware harness. We include three lexical-diversity metrics (MATTR, YULE'S K, and HD-D) and three LLM-judge-based metrics (GTEval, Pairwise Indistinguishability, and Rubric-and-Reason). Across four open datasets, MIRRORBENCH yields variance-aware results and reveals systematic gaps between user proxies and real human users. The framework is open source and includes a simple command-line interface for running experiments, managing configurations and caching, and generating reports. The framework can be accessed at this https URL .

## 28. MemoBrain: Executive Memory as an Agentic Brain for Reasoning
- **Authors**: Hongjin Qian , Zhao Cao , Zheng Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08079](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08079)
- **Abstract**:
> Complex reasoning in tool-augmented agent frameworks is inherently long-horizon, causing reasoning traces and transient tool artifacts to accumulate and strain the bounded working context of large language models. Without explicit memory mechanisms, such accumulation disrupts logical continuity and undermines task alignment. This positions memory not as an auxiliary efficiency concern, but as a core component for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons. We propose MemoBrain, an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing salient intermediate states and their logical relations. Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget. Together, these mechanisms enable explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation. We evaluate MemoBrain on challenging long-horizon benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.

## 29. Semantic Gravity Wells: Why Negative Constraints Backfire
- **Authors**: Shailesh Rana
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08070](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08070)
- **Abstract**:
> Negative constraints (instructions of the form "do not use word X") represent a fundamental test of instruction-following capability in large language models. Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=\sigma(-2.40+2.27\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects. These findings reveal a fundamental tension in negative constraint design: the very act of naming a forbidden word primes the model to produce it.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08000)
- **Abstract**:
> Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) adhere to safety principles without refusing benign requests remains a significant challenge. While OpenAI introduces deliberative alignment (DA) to enhance the safety of its o-series models through reasoning over detailed ``code-like'' safety rules, the effectiveness of this approach in open-source LLMs, which typically lack advanced reasoning capabilities, is understudied. In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of explicitly specifying extensive safety codes versus demonstrating them through illustrative cases. We find that referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors. By guiding LLMs with case-augmented reasoning instead of extensive code-like safety rules, we avoid rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules and enable broader adaptability. Building on these insights, we propose CADA, a case-augmented deliberative alignment method for LLMs utilizing reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains. CADA effectively enhances harmlessness, improves robustness against attacks, and reduces over-refusal while preserving utility across diverse benchmarks, offering a practical alternative to rule-only DA for improving safety while maintaining helpfulness.

## 31. When Models Know When They Do Not Know: Calibration, Cascading, and Cleaning
- **Authors**: Chenjie Hao , Weyl Lu , Yuko Ishiwaka , Zengyi Li , Weier Wan , Yubei Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07965](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07965)
- **Abstract**:
> When a model knows when it does not know, many possibilities emerge. The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

## 32. Executable Ontologies in Game Development: From Algorithmic Control to Semantic World Modeling
- **Authors**: Alexander Boldachev
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07964](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07964)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper examines the application of Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework, to game development. We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybased task interruption through dataflow conditions rather than explicit preemption logic. Comparison with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) reveals that while these approaches model what agents should do, EO models when actions become possible - a fundamental difference that addresses the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture. We discuss integration strategies, debugging advantages inherent to temporal event graphs, and the potential for LLM-driven runtime model generation.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08811](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08811)
- **Abstract**:
> The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning ability has driven research in various domains such as mathematics, coding, and scientific discovery. Meanwhile, 3D visual grounding, as a fundamental task in 3D understanding, still remains challenging due to the limited reasoning ability of recent 3D visual grounding models. Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object. These models often require supervised training on extensive 3D annotation data. On the other hand, recent research also focus on scaling synthetic data to train stronger 3D visual grounding LLM, however, the performance gain remains limited and non-proportional to the data collection cost. In this work, we propose a 3D visual grounding data pipeline, which is capable of automatically synthesizing 3D visual grounding data along with corresponding reasoning process. Additionally, we leverage the generated data for LLM fine-tuning and introduce Reason3DVG-8B, a strong 3D visual grounding LLM that outperforms previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.

## 35. Asymptotic Universal Alignment: A New Alignment Framework via Test-Time Scaling
- **Authors**: Yang Cai , Weiqiang Zheng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08777](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08777)
- **Abstract**:
> Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\to 1$ as $k\to\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general. We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.

## 36. Reliable Graph-RAG for Codebases: AST-Derived Graphs vs LLM-Extracted Knowledge Graphs
- **Authors**: Manideep Reddy Chinthareddy
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08773](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08773)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation for software engineering often relies on vector similarity search, which captures topical similarity but can fail on multi-hop architectural reasoning such as controller to service to repository chains, interface-driven wiring, and inheritance. This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal. Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08748](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08748)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong capabilities in visual-language reasoning, yet their performance on ultra-high-resolution imagery remains largely unexplored. Existing visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks typically rely on medium-resolution data, offering limited visual complexity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Ultra-high-resolution Reasoning Benchmark (UR-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs under extreme visual information. UR-Bench comprises two major categories, Humanistic Scenes and Natural Scenes, covering four subsets of ultra-high-resolution images with distinct spatial structures and data sources. Each subset contains images ranging from hundreds of megapixels to gigapixels, accompanied by questions organized into three levels, enabling evaluation of models' reasoning capabilities in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. We further propose an agent-based framework in which a language model performs reasoning by invoking external visual tools. In addition, we introduce Semantic Abstraction and Retrieval tools that enable more efficient processing of ultra-high-resolution images. We evaluate state-of-the-art models using both an end-to-end MLLMs and our agent-based framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

- **Authors**: Jinbo Su , Yuxuan Hu , Cuiping Li , Hong Chen , Jia Li , Lintao Ma , Jing Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08743](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08743)
- **Abstract**:
> In Text-to-SQL tasks, existing LLM-based methods often include extensive database schemas in prompts, leading to long context lengths and increased prefilling latency. While user queries typically focus on recurrent table sets-offering an opportunity for KV cache sharing across queries-current inference engines, such as SGLang and vLLM, generate redundant prefix cache copies when processing user queries with varying table orders. To address this inefficiency, we propose precomputing table representations as KV caches offline and querying the required ones online. A key aspect of our approach is the computation of table caches while preserving primary foreign key relationships between tables. Additionally, we construct a Table Trie structure to facilitate efficient KV cache lookups during inference. To enhance cache performance, we introduce a cache management system with a query reranking strategy to improve cache hit rates and a computation loading pipeline for parallelizing model inference and cache loading. Experimental results show that our proposed TableCache achieves up to a 3.62x speedup in Time to First Token (TTFT) with negligible performance degradation.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08734)
- **Abstract**:
> Automating Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is challenging, and large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect configurations from natural language (NL). We present TerraFormer, a neuro-symbolic framework for IaC generation and mutation that combines supervised fine-tuning with verifier-guided reinforcement learning, using formal verification tools to provide feedback on syntax, deployability, and policy compliance. We curate two large, high-quality NL-to-IaC datasets, TF-Gen (152k instances) and TF-Mutn (52k instances), via multi-stage verification and iterative LLM self-correction. Evaluations against 17 state-of-the-art LLMs, including ~50x larger models like Sonnet 3.7, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.1, show that TerraFormer improves correctness over its base LLM by 15.94% on IaC-Eval, 11.65% on TF-Gen (Test), and 19.60% on TF-Mutn (Test). It outperforms larger models on both TF-Gen (Test) and TF-Mutn (Test), ranks third on IaC-Eval, and achieves top best-practices and security compliance.

- **Abstract**:
> Summarization of multi-party dialogues is a critical capability in industry, enhancing knowledge transfer and operational effectiveness across many domains. However, automatically generating high-quality summaries is challenging, as the ideal summary must satisfy a set of complex, multi-faceted requirements. While summarization has received immense attention in research, prior work has primarily utilized static datasets and benchmarks, a condition rare in practical scenarios where requirements inevitably evolve. In this work, we present an industry case study on developing an agentic system to summarize multi-party interactions. We share practical insights spanning the full development lifecycle to guide practitioners in building reliable, adaptable summarization systems, as well as to inform future research, covering: 1) robust methods for evaluation despite evolving requirements and task subjectivity, 2) component-wise optimization enabled by the task decomposition inherent in an agentic architecture, 3) the impact of upstream data bottlenecks, and 4) the realities of vendor lock-in due to the poor transferability of LLM prompts.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08654)
- **Abstract**:
> The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm promises scalable rubric-based evaluation, yet aligning frozen black-box models with human standards remains a challenge due to inherent generation stochasticity. We reframe judge alignment as a criteria transfer problem and isolate three recurrent failure modes: rubric instability caused by prompt sensitivity, unverifiable reasoning that lacks auditable evidence, and scale misalignment with human grading boundaries. To address these issues, we introduce RULERS (Rubric Unification, Locking, and Evidence-anchored Robust Scoring), a compiler-executor framework that transforms natural language rubrics into executable specifications. RULERS operates by compiling criteria into versioned immutable bundles, enforcing structured decoding with deterministic evidence verification, and applying lightweight Wasserstein-based post-hoc calibration, all without updating model parameters. Extensive experiments on essay and summarization benchmarks demonstrate that RULERS significantly outperforms representative baselines in human agreement, maintains strong stability against adversarial rubric perturbations, and enables smaller models to rival larger proprietary judges. Overall, our results suggest that reliable LLM judging requires executable rubrics, verifiable evidence, and calibrated scales rather than prompt phrasing alone.

## 42. Moral Lenses, Political Coordinates: Towards Ideological Positioning of Morally Conditioned LLMs
- **Authors**: Chenchen Yuan , Bolei Ma , Zheyu Zhang , Bardh Prenkaj , Frauke Kreuter , Gjergji Kasneci
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08634](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08634)
- **Abstract**:
> While recent research has systematically documented political orientation in large language models (LLMs), existing evaluations rely primarily on direct probing or demographic persona engineering to surface ideological biases. In social psychology, however, political ideology is also understood as a downstream consequence of fundamental moral intuitions. In this work, we investigate the causal relationship between moral values and political positioning by treating moral orientation as a controllable condition. Rather than simply assigning a demographic persona, we condition models to endorse or reject specific moral values and evaluate the resulting shifts on their political orientations, using the Political Compass Test. By treating moral values as lenses, we observe how moral conditioning actively steers model trajectories across economic and social dimensions. Our findings show that such conditioning induces pronounced, value-specific shifts in models' political coordinates. We further notice that these effects are systematically modulated by role framing and model scale, and are robust across alternative assessment instruments instantiating the same moral value. This highlights that effective alignment requires anchoring political assessments within the context of broader social values including morality, paving the way for more socially grounded alignment techniques.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08557](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08557)
- **Abstract**:
> Hallucinations in video-capable vision-language models (Video-VLMs) remain frequent and high-confidence, while existing uncertainty metrics often fail to align with correctness. We introduce VideoHEDGE, a modular framework for hallucination detection in video question answering that extends entropy-based reliability estimation from images to temporally structured inputs. Given a video-question pair, VideoHEDGE draws a baseline answer and multiple high-temperature generations from both clean clips and photometrically and spatiotemporally perturbed variants, then clusters the resulting textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using either Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based or embedding-based methods. Cluster-level probability masses yield three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE). We evaluate VideoHEDGE on the SoccerChat benchmark using an LLM-as-a-judge to obtain binary hallucination labels. Across three 7B Video-VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and a SoccerChat-finetuned model), VASE consistently achieves the highest ROC-AUC, especially at larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often operate near chance. We further show that embedding-based clustering matches NLI-based clustering in detection performance at substantially lower computational cost, and that domain fine-tuning reduces hallucination frequency but yields only modest improvements in calibration. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at this https URL .

## 44. BenchOverflow: Measuring Overflow in Large Language Models via Plain-Text Prompts
- **Authors**: Erin Feiglin , Nir Hutnik , Raz Lapid
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08490](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08490)
- **Abstract**:
> We investigate a failure mode of large language models (LLMs) in which plain-text prompts elicit excessive outputs, a phenomenon we term Overflow. Unlike jailbreaks or prompt injection, Overflow arises under ordinary interaction settings and can lead to elevated serving cost, latency, and cross-user performance degradation, particularly when scaled across many requests. Beyond usability, the stakes are economic and environmental: unnecessary tokens increase per-request cost and energy consumption, compounding into substantial operational spend and carbon footprint at scale. Moreover, Overflow represents a practical vector for compute amplification and service degradation in shared environments. We introduce BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies that amplify output volume without adversarial suffixes or policy circumvention. Using a standardized protocol with a fixed budget of 5000 new tokens, we evaluate nine open- and closed-source models and observe pronounced rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions. Cap-saturation rates (CSR@1k/3k/5k) and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) quantify tail risk; within-prompt variance and cross-model correlations show that Overflow is broadly reproducible yet heterogeneous across families and attack vectors. A lightweight mitigation-a fixed conciseness reminder-attenuates right tails and lowers CSR for all strategies across the majority of models. Our findings position length control as a measurable reliability, cost, and sustainability concern rather than a stylistic quirk. By enabling standardized comparison of length-control robustness across models, BenchOverflow provides a practical basis for selecting deployments that minimize resource waste and operating expense, and for evaluating defenses that curb compute amplification without eroding task performance.

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models frequently generate plausible but unfaithful summaries that users cannot verify against source text, a critical limitation in compliance-sensitive domains such as government and legal analysis. We present sui-1, a 24B parameter model that produces abstractive summaries with inline citations, enabling users to trace each claim to its source sentence. Our synthetic data pipeline combines chain-of-thought prompting with multi-stage verification, generating over 22,000 high-quality training examples across five languages from diverse sources including parliamentary documents, web text, and Wikipedia. Evaluation shows sui-1 significantly outperforms all tested open-weight baselines, including models with 3x more parameters. These results demonstrate that task-specific training substantially outperforms scale alone for citation-grounded summarization. Model weights and an interactive demo are publicly available.

- **Authors**: Jiangshan Duo , Hanyu Li , Hailin Zhang , Yudong Wang , Sujian Li , Liang Zhao

- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a standard paradigm for reasoning in Large Language Models. However, optimizing solely for final-answer correctness often drives models into aimless, verbose exploration, where they rely on exhaustive trial-and-error tactics rather than structured planning to reach solutions. While heuristic constraints like length penalties can reduce verbosity, they often truncate essential reasoning steps, creating a difficult trade-off between efficiency and verification. In this paper, we argue that discriminative capability is a prerequisite for efficient generation: by learning to distinguish valid solutions, a model can internalize a guidance signal that prunes the search space. We propose JudgeRLVR, a two-stage judge-then-generate paradigm. In the first stage, we train the model to judge solution responses with verifiable answers. In the second stage, we fine-tune the same model with vanilla generating RLVR initialized from the judge. Compared to Vanilla RLVR using the same math-domain training data, JudgeRLVR achieves a better quality--efficiency trade-off for Qwen3-30B-A3B: on in-domain math, it delivers about +3.7 points average accuracy gain with -42\% average generation length; on out-of-domain benchmarks, it delivers about +4.5 points average accuracy improvement, demonstrating enhanced generalization.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08464](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08464)
- **Abstract**:
> The conceptual design phase in architecture and urban planning, particularly building massing, is complex and heavily reliant on designer intuition and manual effort. To address this, we propose an automated framework for generating building massing based on functional requirements and site context. A primary obstacle to such data-driven methods has been the lack of suitable datasets. Consequently, we introduce the CoMa-20K dataset, a comprehensive collection that includes detailed massing geometries, associated economical and programmatic data, and visual representations of the development site within its existing urban context. We benchmark this dataset by formulating massing generation as a conditional task for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), evaluating both fine-tuned and large zero-shot models. Our experiments reveal the inherent complexity of the task while demonstrating the potential of VLMs to produce context-sensitive massing options. The dataset and analysis establish a foundational benchmark and highlight significant opportunities for future research in data-driven architectural design.

- **Authors**: Jihang Li , Qing Liu , Zulong Chen , Jing Wang , Wei Wang , Chuanfei Xu , Zeyi Wen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08418](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08418)
- **Abstract**:
> Tax code prediction is a crucial yet underexplored task in automating invoicing and compliance management for large-scale e-commerce platforms. Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.

- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into academic research pipelines; however, the Terms of Service governing their use remain under-examined. We present a comparative analysis of the Terms of Service of five major LLM providers (Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, OpenAI, and xAI) collected in November 2025. Our analysis reveals substantial variation in the stringency and specificity of usage restrictions for general users and researchers. We identify specific complexities for researchers in security research, computational social sciences, and psychological studies. We identify `regulatory gray areas' where Terms of Service create uncertainty for legitimate use. We contribute a publicly available resource comparing terms across platforms (OSF) and discuss implications for general users and researchers navigating this evolving landscape.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08402](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08402)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their potential as educational tutors. However, different tutoring strategies benefit different student personalities, and mismatches can be counterproductive to student outcomes. Despite this, current LLM tutoring systems do not take into account student personality traits. To address this problem, we first construct a taxonomy that links pedagogical methods to personality profiles, based on pedagogical literature. We simulate student-teacher conversations and use our framework to let the LLM tutor adjust its strategy to the simulated student personality. We evaluate the scenario with human teachers and find that they consistently prefer our approach over two baselines. Our method also increases the use of less common, high-impact strategies such as role-playing, which human and LLM annotators prefer significantly. Our findings pave the way for developing more personalized and effective LLM use in educational applications.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08393](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08393)
- **Abstract**:
> Scaling large models requires optimization strategies that ensure rapid convergence grounded in stability. Maximal Update Parametrization ($\boldsymbol{\mu}$P) provides a theoretical safeguard for width-invariant $\Theta(1)$ activation control, whereas emerging optimizers like Muon are only ``half-aligned'' with these constraints: they control updates but allow weights to drift. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates. By deriving the steepest descent direction on the spectral sphere, SSO realizes a fully $\boldsymbol{\mu}$P-aligned optimization process. To enable large-scale training, we implement SSO as an efficient parallel algorithm within Megatron. Through extensive pretraining on diverse architectures, including Dense 1.7B, MoE 8B-A1B, and 200-layer DeepNet models, SSO consistently outperforms AdamW and Muon. Furthermore, we observe significant practical stability benefits, including improved MoE router load balancing, suppressed outliers, and strictly bounded activations.

## 52. Enhancing Sentiment Classification and Irony Detection in Large Language Models through Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques
- **Authors**: Marvin Schmitt , Anne Schwerk , Sebastian Lempert
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08302)
- **Abstract**:
> This study investigates the use of prompt engineering to enhance large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini and gemini-1.5-flash, in sentiment analysis tasks. It evaluates advanced prompting techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency against a baseline. Key tasks include sentiment classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and detecting subtle nuances such as irony. The research details the theoretical background, datasets, and methods used, assessing performance of LLMs as measured by accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Findings reveal that advanced prompting significantly improves sentiment analysis, with the few-shot approach excelling in GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought prompting boosting irony detection in gemini-1.5-flash by up to 46%. Thus, while advanced prompting techniques overall improve performance, the fact that few-shot prompting works best for GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought excels in gemini-1.5-flash for irony detection suggests that prompting strategies must be tailored to both the model and the task. This highlights the importance of aligning prompt design with both the LLM's architecture and the semantic complexity of the task.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08297](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08297)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the $\Delta$-th sub-diagonal for some offset $\Delta$. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.

## 54. HIPPO: Accelerating Video Large Language Models Inference via Holistic-aware Parallel Speculative Decoding
- **Authors**: Qitan Lv , Tianyu Liu , Wen Wu , Xuenan Xu , Bowen Zhou , Feng Wu , Chao Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08273](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08273)
- **Abstract**:
> Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.

- **Abstract**:
> This research analyzed and compared the multi-modal approach in the Vision Transformer(EVA-ViT) based image encoder with the LlaMA or ChatGPT LLM to reduce the hallucination problem and detect diseases in chest x-ray images. In this research, we utilized the NIH Chest X-ray image to train the model and compared it in image-based RAG, text-based RAG, and baseline. [3] [5] In a result, the text-based RAG[2] e!ectively reduces the hallucination problem by using external knowledge information, and the image-based RAG improved the prediction con"dence and calibration by using the KNN methods. [4] Moreover, the GPT LLM showed better performance, a low hallucination rate, and better Expected Calibration Error(ECE) than Llama Llama-based model. This research shows the challenge of data imbalance, a complex multi-stage structure, but suggests a large experience environment and a balanced example of use.

## 56. DNF: Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting for Large Language Model Intellectual Property Protection
- **Authors**: Zhenhua Xu , Yiran Zhao , Mengting Zhong , Dezhang Kong , Changting Lin , Tong Qiao , Meng Han
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08223](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08223)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid growth of large language models raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection under black-box deployment. Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.

## 57. Evaluating Implicit Regulatory Compliance in LLM Tool Invocation via Logic-Guided Synthesis
- **Authors**: Da Song , Yuheng Huang , Boqi Chen , Tianshuo Cong , Randy Goebel , Lei Ma , Foutse Khomh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08196](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08196)
- **Abstract**:
> The integration of large language models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has enabled complex tool use, yet in high-stakes domains, these systems must strictly adhere to regulatory standards beyond simple functional correctness. However, existing benchmarks often overlook implicit regulatory compliance, thus failing to evaluate whether LLMs can autonomously enforce mandatory safety constraints. To fill this gap, we introduce LogiSafetyGen, a framework that converts unstructured regulations into Linear Temporal Logic oracles and employs logic-guided fuzzing to synthesize valid, safety-critical traces. Building on this framework, we construct LogiSafetyBench, a benchmark comprising 240 human-verified tasks that require LLMs to generate Python programs that satisfy both functional objectives and latent compliance rules. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveal that larger models, despite achieving better functional correctness, frequently prioritize task completion over safety, which results in non-compliant behavior.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08189](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08189)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing invasive (backdoor) fingerprints suffer from high-perplexity triggers that are easily filtered, fixed response patterns exposed by heuristic detectors, and spurious activations on benign inputs. We introduce \textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning. It builds a compact, human-readable key--value set with an assistant model and predictive-entropy ranking, then trains lightweight LoRA adapters to suppress the original values on their keys while preserving general capabilities. Ownership is verified under black/gray-box access by aggregating likelihood and semantic evidence into a fingerprint success rate. By relying on probabilistic forgetting traces rather than fixed trigger--response patterns, \textsc{ForgetMark} avoids high-perplexity triggers, reduces detectability, and lowers false triggers. Across diverse architectures and settings, it achieves 100\% ownership verification on fingerprinted models while maintaining standard performance, surpasses backdoor baselines in stealthiness and robustness to model merging, and remains effective under moderate incremental fine-tuning.

- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise in gastroenterology, yet their performance against comprehensive clinical workflows and human benchmarks remains unverified. To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p>0.05). However, a critical "spatial grounding bottleneck" persisted; human lesion localization (mIoU >0.506) significantly outperformed the best model (0.345; p<0.05). Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed a "fluency-accuracy paradox": models generated reports with superior linguistic readability compared with humans (p<0.05) but exhibited significantly lower factual correctness (p<0.05) due to "over-interpretation" and hallucination of visual this http URL -Bench maintains a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the evolving performance of MLLMs in clinical endoscopy.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08176](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08176)
- **Abstract**:
> Automatic evaluation of large language model (LLM) responses requires not only factual correctness but also clarity, particularly in political question-answering. While recent datasets provide human annotations for clarity and evasion, the impact of prompt design on automatic clarity evaluation remains underexplored. In this paper, we study prompt-based clarity evaluation using the CLARITY dataset from the SemEval 2026 shared task. We compare a GPT-3.5 baseline provided with the dataset against GPT-5.2 evaluated under three prompting strategies: simple prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and chain-of-thought with few-shot examples. Model predictions are evaluated against human annotations using accuracy and class-wise metrics for clarity and evasion, along with hierarchical exact match. Results show that GPT-5.2 consistently outperforms the GPT-3.5 baseline on clarity prediction, with accuracy improving from 56 percent to 63 percent under chain-of-thought with few-shot prompting. Chain-of-thought prompting yields the highest evasion accuracy at 34 percent, though improvements are less stable across fine-grained evasion categories. We further evaluate topic identification and find that reasoning-based prompting improves accuracy from 60 percent to 74 percent relative to human annotations. Overall, our findings indicate that prompt design reliably improves high-level clarity evaluation, while fine-grained evasion and topic detection remain challenging despite structured reasoning prompts.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08160](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08160)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic memory systems have become critical for enabling LLM agents to maintain long-term context and retrieve relevant information efficiently. However, existing memory frameworks suffer from a fundamental limitation: they perform exhaustive retrieval across the entire storage layer regardless of query characteristics. This brute-force approach creates severe latency bottlenecks as memory grows, hindering real-time agent interactions. We propose SwiftMem, a query-aware agentic memory system that achieves sub-linear retrieval through specialized indexing over temporal and semantic dimensions. Our temporal index enables logarithmic-time range queries for time-sensitive retrieval, while the semantic DAG-Tag index maps queries to relevant topics through hierarchical tag structures. To address memory fragmentation during growth, we introduce an embedding-tag co-consolidation mechanism that reorganizes storage based on semantic clusters to improve cache locality. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftMem achieves 47$\times$ faster search compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment of memory-augmented LLM agents.

## 62. Enriching Semantic Profiles into Knowledge Graph for Recommender Systems Using Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Seokho Ahn , Sungbok Shin , Young-Duk Seo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08148](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08148)
- **Abstract**:
> Rich and informative profiling to capture user preferences is essential for improving recommendation quality. However, there is still no consensus on how best to construct and utilize such profiles. To address this, we revisit recent profiling-based approaches in recommender systems along four dimensions: 1) knowledge base, 2) preference indicator, 3) impact range, and 4) subject. We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders in real-world settings.

## 63. Qalb: Largest State-of-the-Art Urdu Large Language Model for 230M Speakers with Systematic Continued Pre-training
- **Authors**: Muhammad Taimoor Hassan , Jawad Ahmed , Muhammad Awais
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08141](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08141)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite remarkable progress in large language models, Urdu-a language spoken by over 230 million people-remains critically underrepresented in modern NLP systems. Existing multilingual models demonstrate poor performance on Urdu-specific tasks, struggling with the language's complex morphology, right-to-left Nastaliq script, and rich literary traditions. Even the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model shows limited capability in generating fluent, contextually appropriate Urdu text. We introduce Qalb, an Urdu language model developed through a two-stage approach: continued pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. Starting from LLaMA 3.1 8B, we perform continued pre-training on a dataset of 1.97 billion tokens. This corpus comprises 1.84 billion tokens of diverse Urdu text-spanning news archives, classical and contemporary literature, government documents, and social media-combined with 140 million tokens of English Wikipedia data to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We then fine-tune the resulting model on the Alif Urdu-instruct dataset. Through extensive evaluation on Urdu-specific benchmarks, Qalb demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a weighted average score of 90.34 and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art Alif-1.0-Instruct model (87.1) by 3.24 points, while also surpassing the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model by 44.64 points. Qalb achieves state-of-the-art performance with comprehensive evaluation across seven diverse tasks including Classification, Sentiment Analysis, and Reasoning. Our results demonstrate that continued pre-training on diverse, high-quality language data, combined with targeted instruction fine-tuning, effectively adapts foundation models to low-resource languages.

- **Authors**: Zhichen Zeng , Wenxuan Bao , Xiao Lin , Ruizhong Qiu , Tianxin Wei , Xuying Ning , Yuchen Yan , Chen Luo , Monica Xiao Cheng , Jingrui He , Hanghang Tong
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08139](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08139)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-language models (VLMs), despite their extraordinary zero-shot capabilities, are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08108](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08108)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite notable advancements in prompting methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), existing strategies still suffer from excessive token usage and limited generalisability across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Causal Prompting with Sketch-of-Thought (ACPS) framework, which leverages structural causal models to infer the causal effect of a query on its answer and adaptively select an appropriate intervention (i.e., standard front-door and conditional front-door adjustments). This design enables generalisable causal reasoning across heterogeneous tasks without task-specific retraining. By replacing verbose CoT with concise Sketch-of-Thought, ACPS enables efficient reasoning that significantly reduces token usage and inference cost. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that ACPS consistently outperforms existing prompting baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

## 66. STO-RL: Offline RL under Sparse Rewards via LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order
- **Authors**: Chengyang Gu , Yuxin Pan , Hui Xiong , Yize Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08107](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08107)
- **Abstract**:
> Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.

Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes. Overall, our work provides a practical, turnkey solution for safety-aware deployment.

## 68. Reasoning Beyond Chain-of-Thought: A Latent Computational Mode in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Zhenghao He , Guangzhi Xiong , Bohan Liu , Sanchit Sinha , Aidong Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08058](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08058)
- **Abstract**:
> Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has improved the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear why it works and whether it is the unique mechanism for triggering reasoning in large language models. In this work, we study this question by directly analyzing and intervening on the internal representations of LLMs with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), identifying a small set of latent features that are causally associated with LLM reasoning behavior. Across multiple model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that steering a single reasoning-related latent feature can substantially improve accuracy without explicit CoT prompting. For large models, latent steering achieves performance comparable to standard CoT prompting while producing more efficient outputs. We further observe that this reasoning-oriented internal state is triggered early in generation and can override prompt-level instructions that discourage explicit reasoning. Overall, our results suggest that multi-step reasoning in LLMs is supported by latent internal activations that can be externally activated, while CoT prompting is one effective, but not unique, way of activating this mechanism rather than its necessary cause.

## 69. Representations of Text and Images Align From Layer One
- **Authors**: Evžen Wybitul , Javier Rando , Florian Tramèr , Stanislav Fort
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08017](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08017)
- **Abstract**:
> We show that for a variety of concepts in adapter-based vision-language models, the representations of their images and their text descriptions are meaningfully aligned from the very first layer. This contradicts the established view that such image-text alignment only appears in late layers. We show this using a new synthesis-based method inspired by DeepDream: given a textual concept such as "Jupiter", we extract its concept vector at a given layer, and then use optimisation to synthesise an image whose representation aligns with that vector. We apply our approach to hundreds of concepts across seven layers in Gemma 3, and find that the synthesised images often depict salient visual features of the targeted textual concepts: for example, already at layer 1, more than 50 % of images depict recognisable features of animals, activities, or seasons. Our method thus provides direct, constructive evidence of image-text alignment on a concept-by-concept and layer-by-layer basis. Unlike previous methods for measuring multimodal alignment, our approach is simple, fast, and does not require auxiliary models or datasets. It also offers a new path towards model interpretability, by providing a way to visualise a model's representation space by backtracing through its image processing components.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08003](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08003)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with creative generation, and multi-agent frameworks that improve reasoning through interaction can paradoxically hinder creativity by inducing content homogenization. We introduce LLM Review, a peer-review-inspired framework implementing Blind Peer Review: agents exchange targeted feedback while revising independently, preserving divergent creative trajectories. To enable rigorous evaluation, we propose SciFi-100, a science fiction writing dataset with a unified framework combining LLM-as-a-judge scoring, human annotation, and rule-based novelty metrics. Experiments demonstrate that LLM Review consistently outperforms multi-agent baselines, and smaller models with our framework can surpass larger single-agent models, suggesting interaction structure may substitute for model scale.

## 71. DYCP: Dynamic Context Pruning for Long-Form Dialogue with LLMs
- **Authors**: Nayoung Choi , Jonathan Zhang , Jinho D. Choi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07994](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07994)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit increased response latency and degraded answer quality as dialogue length grows, making effective context management essential. However, existing methods rely on extra LLM calls to build memory or perform offline memory construction without considering the current user utterance, which can introduce inefficiencies or disrupt conversational continuity. We introduce DyCP, a lightweight context management method that dynamically segment and retrieve relevant memory at query time. It preserves the sequential structure of dialogue without predefined topic boundaries and supports efficient, adaptive context retrieval. Across three long-form dialogue benchmarks, LoCoMo, MT-Bench+, and SCM4LLMs, and multiple LLMs, DyCP consistently improves answer quality while reducing response latency. We also examine the gap between modern LLMs' expanded context windows and their actual long-context processing capacity, highlighting the continued importance of effective context management.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07939](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07939)
- **Abstract**:
> Identifying the strengths and limitations of a research paper is a core component of any literature review. However, traditional summaries reflect only the authors' self-presented perspective. Analyzing how other researchers discuss and cite the paper can offer a deeper, more practical understanding of its contributions and shortcomings. In this research, we introduce SECite, a novel approach for evaluating scholarly impact through sentiment analysis of citation contexts. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to extract citations referencing nine research papers and apply advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques with unsupervised machine learning to classify these citation statements as positive or negative. Beyond sentiment classification, we use generative AI to produce sentiment-specific summaries that capture the strengths and limitations of each target paper, derived both from clustered citation groups and from the full text. Our findings reveal meaningful patterns in how the academic community perceives these works, highlighting areas of alignment and divergence between external citation feedback and the authors' own presentation. By integrating citation sentiment analysis with LLM-based summarization, this study provides a comprehensive framework for assessing scholarly contributions.

## 73. Towards Specialized Generalists: A Multi-Task MoE-LoRA Framework for Domain-Specific LLM Adaptation
- **Authors**: Yuxin Yang , Aoxiong Zeng , Xiangquan Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07935)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted focus from general-purpose capabilities to domain-specific expertise. However, adapting LLMs to specialized fields such as medicine presents two challenge: (1) the "Stability-Plasticity Dilemma", where the model must acquire complex clinical knowledge without suffering from catastrophic forgetting of general world knowledge; and (2) "Task Interference", where disparate sub-tasks, such as medical diagnosis, report summarization, and drug-drug interaction prediction, compete for limited low-rank parameter space. In this paper, we propose Med-MoE-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient multi-task domain adaptation, especially for medical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from recent advances, our framework employs an asymmetric expert distribution where deeper layers are equipped with a higher density of LoRA experts to capture complex semantic abstractions. We further introduce a "Knowledge-Preservation Plugin", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms standard LoRA and conventional MoE architectures across multiple clinical NLP tasks while retaining the model's general cognitive capabilities.

## 74. Enhancing Large Language Models for Time-Series Forecasting via Vector-Injected In-Context Learning
- **Authors**: Jianqi Zhang , Jingyao Wang , Wenwen Qiang , Fanjiang Xu , Changwen Zheng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07903](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07903)
- **Abstract**:
> The World Wide Web needs reliable predictive capabilities to respond to changes in user behavior and usage patterns. Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Authors**: Farah Ben Slama (SyCoSMA, LIRIS), Frédéric Armetta (SyCoSMA, LIRIS)
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07898](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07898)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently developed new advanced functionalities. Their effectiveness relies on statistical learning and generalization capabilities. However, they face limitations in internalizing the data they process and struggle, for instance, to autonomously execute algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of extending these models' capabilities to algorithm execution through specialized supervised training focused on reasoning decomposition. We introduce a training model called LLM-DAL (Large Language Model - Decompositional Algorithmic Learning), through which we demonstrate that LLMs' ability to perform complex algorithmic inferences and generalize can be significantly improved when the training method is properly designed to guide the model in its learning process.

## 76. Sherry: Hardware-Efficient 1.25-Bit Ternary Quantization via Fine-grained Sparsification
- **Authors**: Hong Huang , Decheng Wu , Qiangqiang Hu , Guanghua Yu , Jinhai Yang , Jianchen Zhu , Xue Liu , Dapeng Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07892](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07892)
- **Abstract**:
> The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices is increasingly hindered by prohibitive memory and computational requirements. While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up. The code is available at this https URL .

## 77. KVzap: Fast, Adaptive, and Faithful KV Cache Pruning
- **Authors**: Simon Jegou , Maximilian Jeblick
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07891](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07891)
- **Abstract**:
> Growing context lengths in transformer-based language models have made the key-value (KV) cache a critical inference bottleneck. While many KV cache pruning methods have been proposed, they have not yet been adopted in major inference engines due to speed--accuracy trade-offs. We introduce KVzap, a fast, input-adaptive approximation of KVzip that works in both prefilling and decoding. On Qwen3-8B, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Qwen3-32B across long-context and reasoning tasks, KVzap achieves $2$--$4\times$ KV cache compression with negligible accuracy loss and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KVpress leaderboard.

## 78. Small Symbols, Big Risks: Exploring Emoticon Semantic Confusion in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Weipeng Jiang , Xiaoyu Zhang , Juan Zhai , Shiqing Ma , Chao Shen , Yang Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07885](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07885)
- **Abstract**:
> Emoticons are widely used in digital communication to convey affective intent, yet their safety implications for Large Language Models (LLMs) remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify emoticon semantic confusion, a vulnerability where LLMs misinterpret ASCII-based emoticons to perform unintended and even destructive actions. To systematically study this phenomenon, we develop an automated data generation pipeline and construct a dataset containing 3,757 code-oriented test cases spanning 21 meta-scenarios, four programming languages, and varying contextual complexities. Our study on six LLMs reveals that emoticon semantic confusion is pervasive, with an average confusion ratio exceeding 38%. More critically, over 90% of confused responses yield 'silent failures', which are syntactically valid outputs but deviate from user intent, potentially leading to destructive security consequences. Furthermore, we observe that this vulnerability readily transfers to popular agent frameworks, while existing prompt-based mitigations remain largely ineffective. We call on the community to recognize this emerging vulnerability and develop effective mitigation methods to uphold the safety and reliability of the LLM system.

## 79. Sliced-Wasserstein Distribution Alignment Loss Improves the Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Deyu Cao , Yixin Yin , Samin Aref
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07878](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07878)
- **Abstract**:
> The benefits of most large language models come with steep and often hidden economic and environmental costs due to their resource usage inefficiency during deployment. Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods. Our method is available on GitHub to facilitate future progress in ultra-low-bit quantization.

- **Authors**: Fei Ma , Han Lin , Yifan Xie , Hongwei Ren , Xiaoyu Shen , Wenbo Ding , Qi Tian
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07877](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07877)
- **Abstract**:
> Emotion recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains challenging due to high inter-subject variability, limited labeled data, and the lack of interpretable reasoning in existing approaches. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced emotion analysis, they have not been adapted to handle the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of neural signals. We present E^2-LLM (EEG-to-Emotion Large Language Model), the first MLLM framework for interpretable emotion analysis from EEG. E^2-LLM integrates a pretrained EEG encoder with Qwen-based LLMs through learnable projection layers, employing a multi-stage training pipeline that encompasses emotion-discriminative pretraining, cross-modal alignment, and instruction tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning. We design a comprehensive evaluation protocol covering basic emotion prediction, multi-task reasoning, and zero-shot scenario understanding. Experiments on the dataset across seven emotion categories demonstrate that E^2-LLM achieves excellent performance on emotion classification, with larger variants showing enhanced reliability and superior zero-shot generalization to complex reasoning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm combining physiological signals with LLM reasoning capabilities, showing that model scaling improves both recognition accuracy and interpretable emotional understanding in affective computing.

## 81. Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing for Language Models
- **Authors**: Hao-Xiang Xu , Jun-Yu Ma , Ziqi Peng , Yuhao Sun , Zhen-Hua Ling , Jia-Chen Gu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07873](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07873)
- **Abstract**:
> Knowledge editing aims to efficiently modify the internal knowledge of large language models (LLMs) without compromising their other capabilities. The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07853](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07853)
- **Abstract**:
> Financial agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for investment analysis, risk assessment, and automated decision-making, where their abilities to plan, invoke tools, and manipulate mutable state introduce new security risks in high-stakes and highly regulated financial environments. However, existing safety evaluations largely focus on language-model-level content compliance or abstract agent settings, failing to capture execution-grounded risks arising from real operational workflows and state-changing actions. To bridge this gap, we propose FinVault, the first execution-grounded security benchmark for financial agents, comprising 31 regulatory case-driven sandbox scenarios with state-writable databases and explicit compliance constraints, together with 107 real-world vulnerabilities and 963 test cases that systematically cover prompt injection, jailbreaking, financially adapted attacks, as well as benign inputs for false-positive evaluation. Experimental results reveal that existing defense mechanisms remain ineffective in realistic financial agent settings, with average attack success rates (ASR) still reaching up to 50.0\% on state-of-the-art models and remaining non-negligible even for the most robust systems (ASR 6.7\%), highlighting the limited transferability of current safety designs and the need for stronger financial-specific defenses.

## 83. Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low Rank Compression of LLM
- **Authors**: Pawan Kumar , Aditi Gupta
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07839](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07839)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern large language models (LLMs) place extraordinary pressure on memory and compute budgets, making principled compression indispensable for both deployment and continued training. We present Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low-Rank (HSS) compression, a two-stage scheme that (i) removes the largest-magnitude weights into a sparse matrix S and (ii) applies a recursive Hierarchically Sparse Separable (HSS) low-rank factorisation to the dense residual matrix. A recursive rank-reducing strategy and a reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) permutation are introduced to align high weights towards the diagonal with the block-diagonal hierarchy, maximising off-diagonal compressibility (because they are touched only once). HSS is hardware-friendly: its matrix-vector multiply reduces to one sparse and a sequence of thin-matrix multiplications and can be trained end-to-end with standard optimisers. Experiments on LLaMA-7B show that targeting only the self-attention projections (1.6 B parameters of Q, K, and V matrices out of a total 7B parameters) suffices to yield large memory savings while retaining comparable state-of-the-art perplexity scores on test samples of the WikiText dataset. For example, with a 30\% sparsity budget and an outer rank of 512, sHSS-RCM achieves a perplexity of 1.64, outperforming dense baselines and classical sparse-plus-SVD variants, while also achieving significant memory savings.
