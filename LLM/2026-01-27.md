- **Abstract**:
> In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.

- **Authors**: Riyang Bao , Cheng Yang , Dazhou Yu , Zhexiang Tang , Gengchen Mai , Liang Zhao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16965](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16965)
- **Abstract**:
> Geospatial reasoning is essential for real-world applications such as urban analytics, transportation planning, and disaster response. However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.

## 3. AgentDrive: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Agentic AI Reasoning with LLM-Generated Scenarios in Autonomous Systems
- **Authors**: Mohamed Amine Ferrag , Abderrahmane Lakas , Merouane Debbah
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16964](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16964)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at this https URL

## 4. Reasoning Promotes Robustness in Theory of Mind Tasks
- **Authors**: Ian B. de Haan , Peter van der Putten , Max van Duijn
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16853](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16853)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.

- **Authors**: Suzhong Fu , Jingqi Dong , Xuan Ding , Rui Sun , Yiming Yang , Shuguang Cui , Zhen Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16685)
- **Abstract**:
> Evaluating the clinical correctness and reasoning fidelity of automatically generated medical imaging reports remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods often fail to capture the structured diagnostic logic that underlies radiological interpretation, resulting in unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance. We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations. This framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.

## 6. LUMINA: Long-horizon Understanding for Multi-turn Interactive Agents
- **Authors**: Amin Rakhsha , Thomas Hehn , Pietro Mazzaglia , Fabio Valerio Massoli , Arash Behboodi , Tribhuvanesh Orekondy
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16649](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16649)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models can perform well on many isolated tasks, yet they continue to struggle on multi-turn, long-horizon agentic problems that require skills such as planning, state tracking, and long context processing. In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models.

## 7. LLM is Not All You Need: A Systematic Evaluation of ML vs. Foundation Models for text and image based Medical Classification
- **Authors**: Meet Raval , Tejul Pandit , Dhvani Upadhyay
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16549)
- **Abstract**:
> The combination of multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up new possibilities for medical classification. This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.

## 8. SycoEval-EM: Sycophancy Evaluation of Large Language Models in Simulated Clinical Encounters for Emergency Care
- **Authors**: Dongshen Peng , Yi Wang , Carl Preiksaitis , Christian Rose
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16529](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16529)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) show promise in clinical decision support yet risk acquiescing to patient pressure for inappropriate care. We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.

## 9. Doc2AHP: Inferring Structured Multi-Criteria Decision Models via Semantic Trees with LLMs
- **Authors**: Hongjia Wu , Shuai Zhou , Hongxin Zhang , Wei Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16479](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16479)
- **Abstract**:
> While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency in semantic understanding, they often struggle to ensure structural consistency and reasoning reliability in complex decision-making tasks that demand rigorous logic. Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an "expert bottleneck" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.

## 10. SemanticALLI: Caching Reasoning, Not Just Responses, in Agentic Systems
- **Authors**: Varun Chillara , Dylan Kline , Christopher Alvares , Evan Wooten , Huan Yang , Shlok Khetan , Cade Bauer , Tré Guillory , Tanishka Shah , Yashodhara Dhariwal , Volodymyr Pavlov , George Popstefanov
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16286](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16286)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box. We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts. The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.

## 11. When Agents Fail to Act: A Diagnostic Framework for Tool Invocation Reliability in Multi-Agent LLM Systems
- **Authors**: Donghao Huang , Gauri Malwe , Zhaoxia Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16280](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16280)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) are transforming enterprise automation, yet systematic evaluation methodologies for assessing tool-use reliability remain underdeveloped. We introduce a comprehensive diagnostic framework that leverages big data analytics to evaluate procedural reliability in intelligent agent systems, addressing critical needs for SME-centric deployment in privacy-sensitive environments. Our approach features a 12-category error taxonomy capturing failure modes across tool initialization, parameter handling, execution, and result interpretation. Through systematic evaluation of 1,980 deterministic test instances spanning both open-weight models (Qwen2.5 series, Functionary) and proprietary alternatives (GPT-4, Claude 3.5/3.7) across diverse edge hardware configurations, we identify actionable reliability thresholds for production deployment. Our analysis reveals that procedural reliability, particularly tool initialization failures, constitutes the primary bottleneck for smaller models, while qwen2.5:32b achieves flawless performance matching GPT-4.1. The framework demonstrates that mid-sized models (qwen2.5:14b) offer practical accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on commodity hardware (96.6\% success rate, 7.3 s latency), enabling cost-effective intelligent agent deployment for resource-constrained organizations. This work establishes foundational infrastructure for systematic reliability evaluation of tool-augmented multi-agent AI systems.

- **Authors**: Dayal Singh Kalra , Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet , Andrey Gromov , Ishita Mediratta , Kelvin Niu , Alexander H Miller , Michael Shvartsman
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.

## 13. GRIP: Algorithm-Agnostic Machine Unlearning for Mixture-of-Experts via Geometric Router Constraints
- **Authors**: Andy Zhu , Rongzhe Wei , Yupu Gu , Pan Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16905](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16905)
- **Abstract**:
> Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models has become critical for AI safety, yet existing methods fail to generalize to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.

## 14. Evaluating Large Vision-language Models for Surgical Tool Detection
- **Authors**: Nakul Poudel , Richard Simon , Cristian A. Linte
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16895](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16895)
- **Abstract**:
> Surgery is a highly complex process, and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in supporting surgical guidance and decision-making. However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.

## 15. LLM-Based Adversarial Persuasion Attacks on Fact-Checking Systems
- **Authors**: João A. Leite , Olesya Razuvayevskaya , Kalina Bontcheva , Carolina Scarton
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16890](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16890)
- **Abstract**:
> Automated fact-checking (AFC) systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, enabling false claims to evade detection. Existing adversarial frameworks typically rely on injecting noise or altering semantics, yet no existing framework exploits the adversarial potential of persuasion techniques, which are widely used in disinformation campaigns to manipulate audiences. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of persuasive adversarial attacks on AFCs by employing a generative LLM to rephrase claims using persuasion techniques. Considering 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories, we study the effects of persuasion on both claim verification and evidence retrieval using a decoupled evaluation strategy. Experiments on the FEVER and FEVEROUS benchmarks show that persuasion attacks can substantially degrade both verification performance and evidence retrieval. Our analysis identifies persuasion techniques as a potent class of adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for more robust AFC systems.

## 16. Privacy in Human-AI Romantic Relationships: Concerns, Boundaries, and Agency
- **Authors**: Rongjun Ma , Shijing He , Jose Luis Martin-Navarro , Xiao Zhan , Jose Such
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16824](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16824)
- **Abstract**:
> An increasing number of LLM-based applications are being developed to facilitate romantic relationships with AI partners, yet the safety and privacy risks in these partnerships remain largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate privacy in human-AI romantic relationships through an interview study (N=17), examining participants' experiences and privacy perceptions across stages of exploration, intimacy, and dissolution, alongside platforms they used. We found that these relationships took varied forms, from one-to-one to one-to-many, and were shaped by multiple actors, including creators, platforms, and moderators. AI partners were perceived as having agency, actively negotiating privacy boundaries with participants and sometimes encouraging disclosure of personal details. As intimacy deepened, these boundaries became more permeable, though some participants voiced concerns such as conversation exposure and sought to preserve anonymity. Overall, platform affordances and diverse romantic dynamics expand the privacy landscape, underscoring the need to rethink how privacy is constructed in human-AI intimacy.

## 17. Trapped in the past? Disentangling fluid and crystallized intelligence of large language models using chess
- **Authors**: Leonard S. Pleiss , Maximilian Schiffer , Robert K. von Weizsäcker
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16823](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16823)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet it remains unclear to what extent these reflect sophisticated recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning ability (fluid intelligence). We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence.

## 18. GTA: Generative Traffic Agents for Simulating Realistic Mobility Behavior
- **Authors**: Simon Lämmer , Mark Colley , Patrick Ebel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16778](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16778)
- **Abstract**:
> People's transportation choices reflect complex trade-offs shaped by personal preferences, social norms, and technology acceptance. Predicting such behavior at scale is a critical challenge with major implications for urban planning and sustainable transport. Traditional methods use handcrafted assumptions and costly data collection, making them impractical for early-stage evaluations of new technologies or policies. We introduce Generative Traffic Agents (GTA) for simulating large-scale, context-sensitive transportation choices using LLM-powered, persona-based agents. GTA generates artificial populations from census-based sociodemographic data. It simulates activity schedules and mode choices, enabling scalable, human-like simulations without handcrafted rules. We evaluate GTA in Berlin-scale experiments, comparing simulation results against empirical data. While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference. GTA offers new opportunities for modeling how future innovations, from bike lanes to transit apps, shape mobility decisions.

## 19. Do LLM hallucination detectors suffer from low-resource effect?
- **Authors**: Debtanu Datta , Mohan Kishore Chilukuri , Yash Kumar , Saptarshi Ghosh , Muhammad Bilal Zafar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16766](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16766)
- **Abstract**:
> LLMs, while outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks, can still fail in unanticipated ways. We focus on two pervasive failure modes: (i) hallucinations, where models produce incorrect information about the world, and (ii) the low-resource effect, where the models show impressive performance in high-resource languages like English but the performance degrades significantly in low-resource languages like Bengali. We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty. Further, the detectors are robust within language (even for non-English) and in multilingual setups, but not in cross-lingual settings without in-language supervision.

## 20. Standardizing Longitudinal Radiology Report Evaluation via Large Language Model Annotation
- **Authors**: Xinyi Wang , Grazziela Figueredo , Ruizhe Li , Xin Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16753](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16753)
- **Abstract**:
> Longitudinal information in radiology reports refers to the sequential tracking of findings across multiple examinations over time, which is crucial for monitoring disease progression and guiding clinical decisions. Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models. Our LLM-based annotation method outperforms existing annotation solutions, achieving 11.3\% and 5.3\% higher F1-scores for longitudinal information detection and disease tracking, respectively.

Clarke , Hu Wei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16669)
- **Abstract**:
> As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to legal domain-specific tasks, evaluating their ability to perform legal work in real-world settings has become essential. However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: this https URL .

## 22. Revisiting the Role of Natural Language Code Comments in Code Translation
- **Authors**: Monika Gupta , Ajay Meena , Anamitra Roy Choudhury , Vijay Arya , Srikanta Bedathur
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16661](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16661)
- **Abstract**:
> The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era in automated code translation across programming languages. Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments.

- **Abstract**:
> As the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts from parameter scaling to inference-time collaboration, the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) framework has emerged as a general paradigm to harness collective intelligence by layering diverse models. While recent MoA variants have introduced dynamic routing and residual connections to improve efficiency, these methods often fail to facilitate deep semantic interaction between agents, limiting the system's ability to actively correct hallucinations and refine logic. In this paper, we introduce Attention-MoA, a novel MoA-based framework that redefines collaboration through Inter-agent Semantic Attention. Complemented by an Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism, our architecture mitigates information degradation in deep layers while improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK demonstrate that Attention-MoA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 91.15% Length-Controlled Win Rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and dominating in 10 out of 12 capabilities on FLASK. Notably, Attention-MoA enables an ensemble of small open-source models to outperform massive proprietary models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, achieving an MT-Bench score of 8.83 and an AlpacaEval 2.0 LC Win Rate of 77.36%.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16547](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16547)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have garnered significant research interest. Despite being built upon text-based large language models (LLMs), LALMs frequently exhibit a degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize that this limitation stems from the failure of current training paradigms to effectively bridge the acoustic-semantic gap within the feature representation space. To address this challenge, we propose CORD, a unified alignment framework that performs online cross-modal self-distillation. Specifically, it aligns audio-conditioned reasoning with its text-conditioned counterpart within a unified model. Leveraging the text modality as an internal teacher, CORD performs multi-granularity alignment throughout the audio rollout process. At the token level, it employs on-policy reverse KL divergence with importance-aware weighting to prioritize early and semantically critical tokens. At the sequence level, CORD introduces a judge-based global reward to optimize complete reasoning trajectories via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CORD consistently enhances audio-conditioned reasoning and substantially bridges the audio-text performance gap with only 80k synthetic training samples, validating the efficacy and data efficiency of our on-policy, multi-level cross-modal alignment approach.

- **Authors**: Haoyun Yang , Xin Xiao , Jiang Zhong , Yu Tian , Dong Xiaohua , Yu Mao , Hao Wu , Kaiwen Wei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16540)
- **Abstract**:
> Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating speech perception with language understanding. However, whether their internal representations align with human neural dynamics during naturalistic listening remains largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically examine layer-wise representational alignment between 12 open-source Audio LLMs and Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across 2 datasets. Specifically, we employ 8 similarity metrics, such as Spearman-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), to characterize within-sentence representational geometry. Our analysis reveals 3 key findings: (1) we observe a rank-dependence split, in which model rankings vary substantially across different similarity metrics; (2) we identify spatio-temporal alignment patterns characterized by depth-dependent alignment peaks and a pronounced increase in RSA within the 250-500 ms time window, consistent with N400-related neural dynamics; (3) we find an affective dissociation whereby negative prosody, identified using a proposed Tri-modal Neighborhood Consistency (TNC) criterion, reduces geometric similarity while enhancing covariance-based dependence. These findings provide new neurobiological insights into the representational mechanisms of Audio LLMs.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16520](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16520)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16506](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16506)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite the intrinsic risk-awareness of Large Language Models (LLMs), current defenses often result in shallow safety alignment, rendering models vulnerable to disguised attacks (e.g., prefilling) while degrading utility. To bridge this gap, we propose SafeThinker, an adaptive framework that dynamically allocates defensive resources via a lightweight gateway classifier. Based on the gateway's risk assessment, inputs are routed through three distinct mechanisms: (i) a Standardized Refusal Mechanism for explicit threats to maximize efficiency; (ii) a Safety-Aware Twin Expert (SATE) module to intercept deceptive attacks masquerading as benign queries; and (iii) a Distribution-Guided Think (DDGT) component that adaptively intervenes during uncertain generation. Experiments show that SafeThinker significantly lowers attack success rates across diverse jailbreak strategies without compromising utility, demonstrating that coordinating intrinsic judgment throughout the generation process effectively balances robustness and practicality.

## 28. MRAG: Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Bio-medicine
- **Authors**: Wei Zhu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16503](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16503)
- **Abstract**:
> While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been swiftly adopted in scientific and clinical QA systems, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark in the medical domain is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce the Medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) benchmark, covering various tasks in English and Chinese languages, and building a corpus with Wikipedia and Pubmed. Additionally, we develop the MRAG-Toolkit, facilitating systematic exploration of different RAG components. Our experiments reveal that: (a) RAG enhances LLM reliability across MRAG tasks. (b) the performance of RAG systems is influenced by retrieval approaches, model sizes, and prompting strategies. (c) While RAG improves usefulness and reasoning quality, LLM responses may become slightly less readable for long-form questions. We will release the MRAG-Bench's dataset and toolkit with CCBY-4.0 license upon acceptance, to facilitate applications from both academia and industry.

- **Authors**: Xinshuai Guo , Jiayi Kuang , Linyue Pan , Yinghui Li , Yangning Li , Hai-Tao Zheng , Ying Shen , Di Yin , Xing Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16489](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16489)
- **Abstract**:
> A reliable executable environment is the foundation for ensuring that large language models solve software engineering tasks. Due to the complex and tedious construction process, large-scale configuration is relatively inefficient. However, most methods always overlook fine-grained analysis of the actions performed by the agent, making it difficult to handle complex errors and resulting in configuration failures. To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime environments. EvoConfig features an expert diagnosis module for fine-grained post-execution analysis, and a self-evolving mechanism that lets expert agents self-feedback and dynamically adjust error-fixing priorities in real time. Empirically, EvoConfig matches the previous state-of-the-art Repo2Run on Repo2Run's 420 repositories, while delivering clear gains on harder cases: on the more challenging Envbench, EvoConfig achieves a 78.1% success rate, outperforming Repo2Run by 7.1%. Beyond end-to-end success, EvoConfig also demonstrates stronger debugging competence, achieving higher accuracy in error identification and producing more effective repair recommendations than existing methods.

## 30. Timely Machine: Awareness of Time Makes Test-Time Scaling Agentic
- **Authors**: Yichuan Ma , Linyang Li , Yongkang chen , Peiji Li , Xiaozhe Li , Qipeng Guo , Dahua Lin , Kai Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16486](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16486)
- **Abstract**:
> As large language models (LLMs) increasingly tackle complex reasoning tasks, test-time scaling has become critical for enhancing capabilities. However, in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, the traditional generation-length-based definition breaks down: tool latency decouples inference time from generation length. We propose Timely Machine, redefining test-time as wall-clock time, where models dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets. We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality. Moreover, existing models fail to adapt reasoning to time budgets. We propose Timely-RL to address this gap. After cold-start supervised fine-tuning, we use reinforcement learning to enhance temporal planning. Timely-RL improves time budget awareness and consistently boosts performance across Timely-Eval. We hope our work offers a new perspective on test-time scaling for the agentic era.

## 31. Emotion-LLaMAv2 and MMEVerse: A New Framework and Benchmark for Multimodal Emotion Understanding
- **Authors**: Xiaojiang Peng , Jingyi Chen , Zebang Cheng , Bao Peng , Fengyi Wu , Yifei Dong , Shuyuan Tu , Qiyu Hu , Huiting Huang , Yuxiang Lin , Jun-Yan He , Kai Wang , Zheng Lian , Zhi-Qi Cheng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16449](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16449)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding human emotions from multimodal signals poses a significant challenge in affective computing and human-robot interaction. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.

- **Authors**: Jongmin Yu , Hyeontaek Oh , Zhongtian Sun , Angelica I Aviles-Rivero , Moongu Jeon , Jinhong Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16429](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16429)
- **Abstract**:
> Existing face-swapping methods often deliver competitive results in constrained settings but exhibit substantial quality degradation when handling extreme facial poses. To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses. AlphaFace enables stronger identity representation and more precise attribute preservation, all while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive experiments across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF demonstrate that AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging cases. The project is publicly available on ` this https URL .

## 33. Jacobian Scopes: token-level causal attributions in LLMs
- **Authors**: Toni J.B. Liu , Baran Zadeoğlu , Nicolas Boullé , Raphaël Sarfati , Christopher J. Earls
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16407](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16407)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) make next-token predictions based on clues present in their context, such as semantic descriptions and in-context examples. Yet, elucidating which prior tokens most strongly influence a given prediction remains challenging due to the proliferation of layers and attention heads in modern architectures. We propose Jacobian Scopes, a suite of gradient-based, token-level causal attribution methods for interpreting LLM predictions. By analyzing the linearized relations of final hidden state with respect to inputs, Jacobian Scopes quantify how input tokens influence a model's prediction. We introduce three variants - Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes - which respectively target sensitivity of specific logits, the full predictive distribution, and model confidence (inverse temperature). Through case studies spanning instruction understanding, translation and in-context learning (ICL), we uncover interesting findings, such as when Jacobian Scopes point to implicit political biases. We believe that our proposed methods also shed light on recently debated mechanisms underlying in-context time-series forecasting. Our code and interactive demonstrations are publicly available at this https URL .

## 34. ResAgent: Entropy-based Prior Point Discovery and Visual Reasoning for Referring Expression Segmentation
- **Authors**: Yihao Wang , Jusheng Zhang , Ziyi Tang , Keze Wang , Meng Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16394](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16394)
- **Abstract**:
> Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is a core vision-language segmentation task that enables pixel-level understanding of targets via free-form linguistic expressions, supporting critical applications such as human-robot interaction and augmented reality. Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{B}ased Point \textbf{D}iscovery (\textbf{EBD}) and \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{R}easoning (\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg) demonstrate that \model achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in generating accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

## 35. Cross-Lingual Activation Steering for Multilingual Language Models
- **Authors**: Rhitabrat Pokharel , Ameeta Agrawal , Tanay Nagar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16390](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16390)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet significant performance gaps persist between dominant and non-dominant languages. Prior work attributes this gap to imbalances between shared and language-specific neurons in multilingual representations. We propose Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS), a training-free inference-time intervention that selectively modulates neuron activations. We evaluate CLAS on classification and generation benchmarks, achieving average improvements of 2.3% (Acc.) and 3.4% (F1) respectively, while maintaining high-resource language performance. We discover that effective transfer operates through functional divergence rather than strict alignment; performance gains correlate with increased language cluster separation. Our results demonstrate that targeted activation steering can unlock latent multilingual capacity in existing models without modification to model weights.

## 36. Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models
- **Authors**: Bridget Leonard , Scott O. Murray
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16354](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16354)
- **Abstract**:
> Although boosting software development performance, large language model (LLM)-powered code generation introduces intellectual property and data security risks rooted in the fact that a service provider (cloud) observes a client's prompts and generated code, which can be proprietary in commercial systems. To mitigate this problem, we propose NOIR, the first framework to protect the client's prompts and generated code from the cloud. NOIR uses an encoder and a decoder at the client to encode and send the prompts' embeddings to the cloud to get enriched embeddings from the LLM, which are then decoded to generate the code locally at the client. Since the cloud can use the embeddings to infer the prompt and the generated code, NOIR introduces a new mechanism to achieve indistinguishability, a local differential privacy protection at the token embedding level, in the vocabulary used in the prompts and code, and a data-independent and randomized tokenizer on the client side. These components effectively defend against reconstruction and frequency analysis attacks by an honest-but-curious cloud. Extensive analysis and results using open-source LLMs show that NOIR significantly outperforms existing baselines on benchmarks, including the Evalplus (MBPP and HumanEval, Pass@1 of 76.7 and 77.4), and BigCodeBench (Pass@1 of 38.7, only a 1.77% drop from the original LLM) under strong privacy against attacks.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16349](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16349)
- **Abstract**:
> This study investigates regional bias in large language models (LLMs), an emerging concern in AI fairness and global representation. We evaluate ten prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Gemma 7B, Mistral 7B, and Vicuna-13B using a dataset of 100 carefully designed prompts that probe forced-choice decisions between regions under contextually neutral scenarios. We introduce FAZE, a prompt-based evaluation framework that measures regional bias on a 10-point scale, where higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to favor specific regions. Experimental results reveal substantial variation in bias levels across models, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting the highest bias score (9.5) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scoring the lowest (2.5). These findings indicate that regional bias can meaningfully undermine the reliability, fairness, and inclusivity of LLM outputs in real-world, cross-cultural applications. This work contributes to AI fairness research by highlighting the importance of inclusive evaluation frameworks and systematic approaches for identifying and mitigating geographic biases in language models.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16314](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16314)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) enable rapid and consistent automated evaluation of open-ended exam responses, including dimensions of content and argumentation that have traditionally required human judgment. This is particularly important in cases where a large amount of exams need to be graded in a limited time frame, such as nation-wide graduation exams in various countries. Here, we examine the applicability of automated scoring on two large datasets of trial exam essays of two full national cohorts from Estonia. We operationalize the official curriculum-based rubric and compare LLM and statistical natural language processing (NLP) based assessments with human panel scores. The results show that automated scoring can achieve performance comparable to that of human raters and tends to fall within the human scoring range. We also evaluate bias, prompt injection risks, and LLMs as essay writers. These findings demonstrate that a principled, rubric-driven, human-in-the-loop scoring pipeline is viable for high-stakes writing assessment, particularly relevant for digitally advanced societies like Estonia, which is about to adapt a fully electronic examination system. Furthermore, the system produces fine-grained subscore profiles that can be used to generate systematic, personalized feedback for instruction and exam preparation. The study provides evidence that LLM-assisted assessment can be implemented at a national scale, even in a small-language context, while maintaining human oversight and compliance with emerging educational and regulatory standards.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16312](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16312)
- **Abstract**:
> Research in AI4Science has shown promise in many science applications, including polymer design. However, current LLMs prove ineffective on this problem space because: (i) most models lack polymer-specific knowledge (ii) existing aligned models lack coverage of knowledge and capabilities relevant to polymer design. Addressing this, we introduce PolyBench, a large scale training and test benchmark dataset of more than 125K polymer design related tasks, leveraging a knowledge base of 13M+ data points obtained from experimental and synthetic sources to ensure broad coverage of polymers and their properties. For effective alignment using PolyBench, we introduce a knowledge-augmented reasoning distillation method that augments this dataset with structured CoT. Furthermore, tasks in PolyBench are organized from simple to complex analytical reasoning problems, enabling generalization tests and diagnostic probes across the problem space. Experiments show that small language models (SLMs), of 7B to 14B parameters, trained on PolyBench data outperform similar sized models, and even closed source frontier LLMs on PolyBench test dataset while demonstrating gains on other polymer benchmarks as well.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16282](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16282)
- **Abstract**:
> Contemporary automated scientific discovery has focused on agents for generating scientific experiments, while systems that perform higher-level scientific activities such as theory building remain underexplored. In this work, we formulate the problem of synthesizing theories consisting of qualitative and quantitative laws from large corpora of scientific literature. We study theory generation at scale, using 13.7k source papers to synthesize 2.9k theories, examining how generation using literature-grounding versus parametric knowledge, and accuracy-focused versus novelty-focused generation objectives change theory properties. Our experiments show that, compared to using parametric LLM memory for generation, our literature-supported method creates theories that are significantly better at both matching existing evidence and at predicting future results from 4.6k subsequently-written papers

## 42. Better as Generators Than Classifiers: Leveraging LLMs and Synthetic Data for Low-Resource Multilingual Classification
- **Authors**: Branislav Pecher , Jan Cegin , Robert Belanec , Ivan Srba , Jakub Simko , Maria Bielikova
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16278)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual capabilities, making them promising tools in both high- and low-resource languages. One particularly valuable use case is generating synthetic samples that can be used to train smaller models in low-resource scenarios where human-labelled data is scarce. In this work, we investigate whether these synthetic data generation capabilities can serve as a form of distillation, producing smaller models that perform on par with or even better than massive LLMs across languages and tasks. To this end, we use a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM to generate synthetic datasets covering 11 languages and 4 classification tasks. These datasets are then used to train smaller models via fine-tuning or instruction tuning, or as synthetic in-context examples for compact LLMs. Our experiments show that even small amounts of synthetic data enable smaller models to outperform the large generator itself, particularly in low-resource languages. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs are best utilised as generators (teachers) rather than classifiers, producing data that empowers smaller and more efficient multilingual models.

## 43. GameTalk: Training LLMs for Strategic Conversation
- **Authors**: Victor Conchello Vendrell , Max Ruiz Luyten , Mihaela van der Schaar
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16276](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16276)
- **Abstract**:
> Strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings is a key challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when coordination and negotiation must unfold over extended conversations. While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce \textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains. These findings position conversational fine-tuning as a promising path for LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act in interactive environments.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16238](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16238)
- **Abstract**:
> VIBETENSOR is an open-source research system software stack for deep learning, generated by LLM-powered coding agents under high-level human guidance. In this paper, "fully generated" refers to code provenance: implementation changes were produced and applied as agent-proposed diffs; validation relied on agent-run builds, tests, and differential checks, without per-change manual diff review. It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental this http URL interface. Unlike thin bindings, VIBETENSOR includes its own tensor/storage system, schema-lite dispatcher, reverse-mode autograd, CUDA runtime (streams/events/graphs), a stream-ordered caching allocator with diagnostics, and a stable C ABI for dynamically loaded operator plugins. We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention. We also report end-to-end training sanity checks on 3 small workloads (sequence reversal, ViT, miniGPT) on NVIDIA H100 (Hopper, SM90) and Blackwell-class GPUs; multi-GPU results are Blackwell-only and use an optional CUTLASS-based ring-allreduce plugin gated on CUDA 13+ and sm103a toolchain support. Finally, we discuss failure modes in generated system software, including a "Frankenstein" composition effect where locally correct subsystems interact to yield globally suboptimal performance.

> Multimodal foundation models that integrate audio, vision, and language achieve strong performance on reasoning and generation tasks, yet their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains poorly understood. We study a realistic and underexplored threat model: untargeted, audio-only adversarial attacks on trimodal audio-video-language models. We analyze six complementary attack objectives that target different stages of multimodal processing, including audio encoder representations, cross-modal attention, hidden states, and output likelihoods. Across three state-of-the-art models and multiple benchmarks, we show that audio-only perturbations can induce severe multimodal failures, achieving up to 96% attack success rate. We further show that attacks can be successful at low perceptual distortions (LPIPS <= 0.08, SI-SNR >= 0) and benefit more from extended optimization than increased data scale. Transferability across models and encoders remains limited, while speech recognition systems such as Whisper primarily respond to perturbation magnitude, achieving >97% attack success under severe distortion. These results expose a previously overlooked single-modality attack surface in multimodal systems and motivate defenses that enforce cross-modal consistency.

## 46. Zero-Shot Speech LLMs for Multi-Aspect Evaluation of L2 Speech: Challenges and Opportunities
- **Authors**: Aditya Kamlesh Parikh , Cristian Tejedor-Garcia , Catia Cucchiarini , Helmer Strik
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16230](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16230)
- **Abstract**:
> An accurate assessment of L2 English pronunciation is crucial for language learning, as it provides personalized feedback and ensures a fair evaluation of individual progress. However, automated scoring remains challenging due to the complexity of sentence-level fluency, prosody, and completeness. This paper evaluates the zero-shot performance of Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, an instruction-tuned speech-LLM, on 5,000 Speechocean762 utterances. The model generates rubric-aligned scores for accuracy, fluency, prosody, and completeness, showing strong agreement with human ratings within +-2 tolerance, especially for high-quality speech. However, it tends to overpredict low-quality speech scores and lacks precision in error detection. These findings demonstrate the strong potential of speech LLMs in scalable pronunciation assessment and suggest future improvements through enhanced prompting, calibration, and phonetic integration to advance Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training.

## 47. ES4R: Speech Encoding Based on Prepositive Affective Modeling for Empathetic Response Generation

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16225](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16225)
- **Abstract**:
> Empathetic speech dialogue requires not only understanding linguistic content but also perceiving rich paralinguistic information such as prosody, tone, and emotional intensity for affective understandings. Existing speech-to-speech large language models either rely on ASR transcription or use encoders to extract latent representations, often weakening affective information and contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we propose \textbf{ES4R}, a framework for speech-based empathetic response generation. Our core innovation lies in explicitly modeling structured affective context before speech encoding, rather than relying on implicit learning by the encoder or explicit emotion supervision. Specifically, we introduce a dual-level attention mechanism to capture turn-level affective states and dialogue-level affective dynamics. The resulting affective representations are then integrated with textual semantics through speech-guided cross-modal attention to generate empathetic responses. For speech output, we employ energy-based strategy selection and style fusion to achieve empathetic speech synthesis. ES4R consistently outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and human evaluations and remains robust across different LLM backbones.

## 48. Domain Specific Specialization in Low-Resource Settings: The Efficacy of Offline Response-Based Knowledge Distillation in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Erdem Aslan , Pakize Erdoğmuş
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16219](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16219)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but often struggle with hallucinations when handling domain-specific or institutional knowledge absent from their pre-training. We present an offline response-based knowledge distillation method that develops high-accuracy specialized assistants under constrained hardware resources. We evaluate three distinct data strategies: general domain adaptation (15,000 lines), unstructured knowledge injection (2,000 lines), and a context-aware synthetic dataset (500 lines) generated by a teacher model. To minimize computational costs, we utilize the Unsloth library to optimize the Qwen-2.5-7B student model, reducing NVIDIA A100 GPU memory requirements from 40 GB to 16 GB. Experimental results demonstrate that while larger unstructured datasets suffer from persistent hallucinations, the 500-line context-aware dataset achieves a 96.7% accuracy rate and robust rejection capability. These findings validate the LIMA hypothesis, showing that data quality and structural alignment are more critical than quantity for domain adaptation in low-resource settings.

## 49. M3Kang: Evaluating Multilingual Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Aleix Torres-Camps , Nathaniel Mitrani Hadida , Víctor Conchello Vendrell , Àlex Batlle Casellas , Arnau Padrés Masdemont , Jordi Ros-Giralt
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16218](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16218)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, their performance in multilingual mathematical reasoning remains underexplored, particularly when compared to human performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce M3Kang, the first massively multilingual, multimodal mathematical reasoning dataset for VLMs. It is derived from the Kangaroo Math Competition, the world's largest mathematics contest, which annually engages over six million participants under the age of 18 across more than 90 countries. M3Kang includes 1,747 unique multiple-choice problems organized by grade-level difficulty, with translations into 108 culturally diverse languages, some of them including diagrams essential for solving them. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive benchmarking on both closed- and open-source SOTA models. We observe that, despite recent advances, models still struggle with basic math and diagram-based reasoning, with performance scaling with language presence and model size, but not with grade level. We also find that multilingual techniques can be effectively extended to the multimodal setting, resulting in significant improvements over baseline approaches. Our analysis also incorporates performance data from over 68,000 students, enabling direct comparison with human performance. We are open-sourcing M3Kang, including the English-only subset M2Kang, along with the framework and codebase used to construct the dataset.

## 50. ChiEngMixBench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Spontaneous and Natural Chinese-English Code-Mixed Generation
- **Authors**: Qingyan Yang , Tongxi Wang , Yunsheng Luo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16217](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16217)
- **Abstract**:
> Code-mixing is increasingly prevalent in interactions between humans and large language models, yet existing work often reduces it to a translation or convertibility problem, making it difficult to assess whether a model's switching behavior is context-appropriate and aligned with human conventions. We introduce ChiEngMixBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate code-mixing ability in authentic community contexts, built upon a general construction pipeline that enables scalable dataset development across domains and bilingual pairs. ChiEngMixBench formulates code-mixing as a cognitive alignment problem, characterized by two complementary signals: Spontaneity and Naturalness. Empirical evaluation shows that our metrics can systematically distinguish code-mixing performance across models. Beyond benchmarking, we further uncover an implicitly emergent Terminology Layering Strategy, a phenomenon consistent with the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) theory, indicating structured cognitive alignment between multilingual large language models and human communication.
