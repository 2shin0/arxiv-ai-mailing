- **Abstract**:
> The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.

## 2. Invasive Context Engineering to Control Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Thomas Rivasseau
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03001](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03001)
- **Abstract**:
> Current research on operator control of Large Language Models improves model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on preference examples, prompting, and input/output filtering. Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.

- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

- **Authors**: Yongrui Yu , Zhongzhen Huang , Linjie Mu , Shaoting Zhang , Xiaofan Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02814](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02814)
- **Abstract**:
> Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02726](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02726)
- **Abstract**:
> Auditors rely on Journal Entry Tests (JETs) to detect anomalies in tax-related ledger records, but rule-based methods generate overwhelming false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as anomaly detectors in double-entry bookkeeping. Benchmarking SoTA LLMs such as LLaMA and Gemma on both synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, we compare them against JETs and machine learning baselines. Our results show that LLMs consistently outperform traditional rule-based JETs and classical ML baselines, while also providing natural-language explanations that enhance interpretability. These results highlight the potential of \textbf{AI-augmented auditing}, where human auditors collaborate with foundation models to strengthen financial integrity.

## 6. StockMem: An Event-Reflection Memory Framework for Stock Forecasting
- **Authors**: He Wang , Wenyilin Xiao , Songqiao Han , Hailiang Huang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02720](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02720)
- **Abstract**:
> Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02716](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02716)
- **Abstract**:
> Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring. Code is available at: this https URL

## 8. Training Data Attribution for Image Generation using Ontology-Aligned Knowledge Graphs
- **Authors**: Theodoros Aivalis , Iraklis A. Klampanos , Antonis Troumpoukis , Joemon M. Jose
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02713](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02713)
- **Abstract**:
> As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

## 9. Learning What to Attend First: Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning for Reliable Multimodal Emotion Understanding
- **Authors**: Hyeongseop Rha , Jeong Hun Yeo , Junil Won , Se Jin Park , Yong Man Ro
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02699](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02699)
- **Abstract**:
> In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

## 10. Exploring Depth Generalization in Large Language Models for Solving Recursive Logic Tasks
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan He
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02677](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02677)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02589](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02589)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02499](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02499)
- **Abstract**:
> Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

## 13. Semantic Trading: Agentic AI for Clustering and Relationship Discovery in Prediction Markets
- **Authors**: Agostino Capponi , Alfio Gliozzo , Brian Zhu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02436](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02436)
- **Abstract**:
> Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

## 14. Synthetic Error Injection Fails to Elicit Self-Correction In Language Models
- **Authors**: David X. Wu , Shreyas Kapur , Anant Sahai , Stuart Russell
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02389](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02389)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

## 15. Beyond Playtesting: A Generative Multi-Agent Simulation System for Massively Multiplayer Online Games
- **Authors**: Ran Zhang , Kun Ouyang , Tiancheng Ma , Yida Yang , Dong Fang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02358)
- **Abstract**:
> Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

## 16. Reasoning Path and Latent State Analysis for Multi-view Visual Spatial Reasoning: A Cognitive Science Perspective
- **Authors**: Qiyao Xue , Weichen Liu , Shiqi Wang , Haoming Wang , Yuyang Wu , Wei Gao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02340](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02340)
- **Abstract**:
> Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at this https URL , and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at this https URL .

## 17. OmniGuard: Unified Omni-Modal Guardrails with Deliberate Reasoning
- **Authors**: Boyu Zhu , Xiaofei Wen , Wenjie Jacky Mo , Tinghui Zhu , Yanan Xie , Peng Qi , Muhao Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02306](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02306)
- **Abstract**:
> Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

## 18. DialogGuard: Multi-Agent Psychosocial Safety Evaluation of Sensitive LLM Responses
- **Authors**: Han Luo , Guy Laban
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02282](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02282)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental- health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent frame- work for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discrimi- natory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse gen- erative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi- agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog- Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language ratio- nales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.

## 19. TradeTrap: Are LLM-based Trading Agents Truly Reliable and Faithful?
- **Authors**: Lewen Yan , Jilin Mei , Tianyi Zhou , Lige Huang , Jie Zhang , Dongrui Liu , Jing Shao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02261](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02261)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level. Our code is available at this https URL .

## 20. Benchmarking LLM Agents for Wealth-Management Workflows
- **Authors**: Rory Milsom
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02230](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02230)
- **Abstract**:
> Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

## 21. STRIDE: A Systematic Framework for Selecting AI Modalities - Agentic AI, AI Assistants, or LLM Calls
- **Authors**: Shubhi Asthana , Bing Zhang , Chad DeLuca , Ruchi Mahindru , Hima Patel
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02228)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk. We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context. Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

## 22. Flowchart2Mermaid: A Vision-Language Model Powered System for Converting Flowcharts into Editable Diagram Code
- **Authors**: Pritam Deka , Barry Devereux
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02170](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02170)
- **Abstract**:
> Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present Flowchart2Mermaid, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable this http URL code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

## 23. The 4/$δ$ Bound: Designing Predictable LLM-Verifier Systems for Formal Method Guarantee
- **Authors**: PIerre Dantas , Lucas Cordeiro , Youcheng Sun , Waldir Junior
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02080](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02080)
- **Abstract**:
> The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\delta$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\delta > 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/\delta$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

## 24. The Moral Consistency Pipeline: Continuous Ethical Evaluation for Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Saeid Jamshidi , Kawser Wazed Nafi , Arghavan Moradi Dakhel , Negar Shahabi , Foutse Khomh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03026)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03025)
- **Abstract**:
> Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.

## 26. TokenPowerBench: Benchmarking the Power Consumption of LLM Inference
- **Authors**: Chenxu Niu , Wei Zhang , Jie Li , Yongjian Zhao , Tongyang Wang , Xi Wang , Yong Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03024)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language model (LLM) services now answer billions of queries per day, and industry reports show that inference, not training, accounts for more than 90% of total power consumption. However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services.

## 27. Distribution-Calibrated Inference time compute for Thinking LLM-as-a-Judge
- **Authors**: Hamid Dadkhahi , Firas Trabelsi , Parker Riley , Juraj Juraska , Mehdi Mirzazadeh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03019)
- **Abstract**:
> Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) used as judges for pairwise preferences remain noisy at the single-sample level, and common aggregation rules (majority vote, soft self-consistency, or instruction-based self-aggregation) are inconsistent when ties are allowed. We study inference-time compute (ITC) for evaluators that generate n independent thinking-rating samples per item, and propose a principled, distribution-calibrated aggregation scheme. Our method models three-way preferences with a Bradley-Terry-Davidson formulation on rating counts, leveraging both polarity (margin among non-ties) and decisiveness (non-tie rate) to distinguish narrow margins from strong consensus. Across various evaluation benchmarks, our approach consistently reduces MAE and increases pairwise accuracy versus standard baselines, and when evaluated against human-consensus meta-labels, matches or exceeds individual human raters. These results show that carefully allocating ITC and aggregating with distribution-aware methods turns noisy individual model judgments into reliable ratings for evaluation.

## 28. Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Logical Translation: Reducing Hallucinations with Lang2Logic
- **Authors**: Muyu Pan , Dheeraj Kodakandla , Mahfuza Farooque
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02987](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02987)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

## 29. Lumos: Let there be Language Model System Certification
- **Authors**: Isha Chaudhary , Vedaant Jain , Avaljot Singh , Kavya Sachdeva , Sayan Ranu , Gagandeep Singh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02966](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02966)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce the first principled framework, Lumos, for specifying and formally certifying Language Model System (LMS) behaviors. Lumos is an imperative probabilistic programming DSL over graphs, with constructs to generate independent and identically distributed prompts for LMS. It offers a structured view of prompt distributions via graphs, forming random prompts from sampled subgraphs. Lumos supports certifying LMS for arbitrary prompt distributions via integration with statistical certifiers. We provide hybrid (operational and denotational) semantics for Lumos, providing a rigorous way to interpret the specifications. Using only a small set of composable constructs, Lumos can encode existing LMS specifications, including complex relational and temporal specifications. It also facilitates specifying new properties - we present the first safety specifications for vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving scenarios developed with Lumos. Using these, we show that the state-of-the-art VLM Qwen-VL exhibits critical safety failures, producing incorrect and unsafe responses with at least 90% probability in right-turn scenarios under rainy driving conditions, revealing substantial safety risks. Lumos's modular structure allows easy modification of the specifications, enabling LMS certification to stay abreast with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. We further demonstrate that specification programs written in Lumos enable finding specific failure cases exhibited by state-of-the-art LMS. Lumos is the first systematic and extensible language-based framework for specifying and certifying LMS behaviors, paving the way for a wider adoption of LMS certification.

## 30. In Silico Development of Psychometric Scales: Feasibility of Representative Population Data Simulation with LLMs
- **Authors**: Enrico Cipriani , Pavel Okopnyi , Danilo Menicucci , Simone Grassini
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02910](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02910)
- **Abstract**:
> Developing and validating psychometric scales requires large samples, multiple testing phases, and substantial resources. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the generation of synthetic participant data by prompting models to answer items while impersonating individuals of specific demographic profiles, potentially allowing in silico piloting before real data collection. Across four preregistered studies (N = circa 300 each), we tested whether LLM-simulated datasets can reproduce the latent structures and measurement properties of human responses. In Studies 1-2, we compared LLM-generated data with real datasets for two validated scales; in Studies 3-4, we created new scales using EFA on simulated data and then examined whether these structures generalized to newly collected human samples. Simulated datasets replicated the intended factor structures in three of four studies and showed consistent configural and metric invariance, with scalar invariance achieved for the two newly developed scales. However, correlation-based tests revealed substantial differences between real and synthetic datasets, and notable discrepancies appeared in score distributions and variances. Thus, while LLMs capture group-level latent structures, they do not approximate individual-level data properties. Simulated datasets also showed full internal invariance across gender. Overall, LLM-generated data appear useful for early-stage, group-level psychometric prototyping, but not as substitutes for individual-level validation. We discuss methodological limitations, risks of bias and data pollution, and ethical considerations related to in silico psychometric simulations.

## 31. MRD: Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection Fusion for High-Resolution Image Understanding
- **Authors**: Fan Yang , Kaihao Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02906](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02906)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window this http URL on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

## 32. FAIRY2I: Universal Extremely-Low Bit QAT framework via Widely-Linear Representation and Phase-Aware Quantization
- **Authors**: Feiyu Wang , Xinyu Tan , Bokai Huang , Yihao Zhang , Guoan Wang , Peizhuang Cong , Tong Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02901](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02901)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

## 33. OptPO: Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization
- **Authors**: Youkang Wang , Jian Wang , Rubing Chen , Tianyi Zeng , Xiao-Yong Wei , Qing Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02882](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02882)
- **Abstract**:
> Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.

- **Authors**: Mikołaj Sacha , Hammad Jafri , Mattie Terzolo , Ayan Sinha , Andrew Rabinovich
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02849](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02849)
- **Abstract**:
> Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02841](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02841)
- **Abstract**:
> System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

## 36. ReVSeg: Incentivizing the Reasoning Chain for Video Segmentation with Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Yifan Li , Yingda Yin , Lingting Zhu , Weikai Chen , Shengju Qian , Xin Wang , Yanwei Fu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02835](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02835)
- **Abstract**:
> Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

## 37. A Comparative Study on How Data Normalization Affects Zero-Shot Generalization in Time Series Foundation Models
- **Authors**: Ihab Ahmed , Denis Krompaß , Cheng Feng , Volker Tresp
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02833](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02833)
- **Abstract**:
> We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).

## 38. Phase-Adaptive LLM Framework with Multi-Stage Validation for Construction Robot Task Allocation: A Systematic Benchmark Against Traditional Optimization Algorithms
- **Authors**: Shyam prasad reddy Kaitha , Hongrui Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02810](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02810)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-robot task allocation in construction automation has traditionally relied on optimization methods such as Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction this http URL study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later this http URL authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02763)
- **Abstract**:
> LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

## 40. Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion for Hateful Video Detection
- **Authors**: Shuonan Yang , Tailin Chen , Jiangbei Yue , Guangliang Cheng , Jianbo Jiao , Zeyu Fu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02743](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02743)
- **Abstract**:
> Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

## 41. Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs
- **Authors**: Julian Ma , Jun Wang , Zafeirios Fountas
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric ( this https URL ) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

## 42. An Empirical Survey of Model Merging Algorithms for Social Bias Mitigation
- **Authors**: Daiki Shirafuji , Tatsuhiko Saito , Yasutomo Kimura
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02689](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02689)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

## 43. Beyond Single-Agent Safety: A Taxonomy of Risks in LLM-to-LLM Interactions
- **Authors**: Piercosma Bisconti , Marcello Galisai , Federico Pierucci , Marcantonio Bracale , Matteo Prandi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02682)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper examines why safety mechanisms designed for human-model interaction do not scale to environments where large language models (LLMs) interact with each other. Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior. The paper contributes (i) a theoretical account of collective risk in interacting LLMs, (ii) a taxonomy connecting micro, meso, and macro-level failure modes, and (iii) a design proposal for InstitutionalAI, an architecture for embedding adaptive oversight within multi-agent systems.

## 44. Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT): Fast and Accurate Molecular Generation via High-Fidelity Discrete Latents
- **Authors**: Haozhuo Zheng , Cheng Wang , Yang Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02667](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02667)
- **Abstract**:
> The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02625](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02625)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) excel at many general-purpose natural language processing tasks. However, their ability to perform deep reasoning and mathematical analysis, particularly for complex tasks as required in cryptography, remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of suitable data for evaluation and training. To address this gap, we present CryptoQA, the first large-scale question-answering (QA) dataset specifically designed for cryptography. CryptoQA contains over two million QA pairs drawn from curated academic sources, along with contextual metadata that can be used to test the cryptographic capabilities of LLMs and to train new LLMs on cryptographic tasks. We benchmark 15 state-of-the-art LLMs on CryptoQA, evaluating their factual accuracy, mathematical reasoning, consistency, referencing, backward reasoning, and robustness to adversarial samples. In addition to quantitative metrics, we provide expert reviews that qualitatively assess model outputs and establish a gold-standard baseline. Our results reveal significant performance deficits of LLMs, particularly on tasks that require formal reasoning and precise mathematical knowledge. This shows the urgent need for LLM assistants tailored to cryptography research and development. We demonstrate that, by using CryptoQA, LLMs can be fine-tuned to exhibit better performance on cryptographic tasks.

- **Authors**: Martin Weiss , Jesko Hecking-Harbusch , Jochen Quante , Matthias Woehrle
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02567)
- **Abstract**:
> The advent of strong generative AI has a considerable impact on various software engineering tasks such as code repair, test generation, or language translation. While tools like GitHub Copilot are already in widespread use in interactive settings, automated approaches require a higher level of reliability before being usable in industrial practice. In this paper, we focus on three aspects that directly influence the quality of the results: a) the effect of automated feedback loops, b) the choice of Large Language Model (LLM), and c) the influence of behavior-preserving code changes. We study the effect of these three variables on an automated C-to-Rust translation system. Code translation from C to Rust is an attractive use case in industry due to Rust's safety guarantees. The translation system is based on a generate-and-check pattern, in which Rust code generated by the LLM is automatically checked for compilability and behavioral equivalence with the original C code. For negative checking results, the LLM is re-prompted in a feedback loop to repair its output. These checks also allow us to evaluate and compare the respective success rates of the translation system when varying the three variables. Our results show that without feedback loops LLM selection has a large effect on translation success. However, when the translation system uses feedback loops the differences across models diminish. We observe this for the average performance of the system as well as its robustness under code perturbations. Finally, we also identify that diversity provided by code perturbations can even result in improved system performance.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02566](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02566)
- **Abstract**:
> There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02561](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02561)
- **Abstract**:
> With the rapid development of the online education and large language model, the existing educational tools still suffer from incomplete service, insufficient performance and weak interactivity in terms of courseware generation, interactive notes and quality assurance of content. In particular, the proposed generative agent EZYer : 1) Teacher Module: Integrating the Text Corpus retrieval and in-depth generation technologies, it automatically generates structured teaching materials and LaTeX Beamer courseware in line with the high school mathematics syllabus and supports user-defined image insertion. 2) Student Module: Throughout the collaborative interaction of the four roles of Teacher, Assistant, Top Student and Struggling Student, Note Taker summarizes and generates academic notes to enhance the depth and interest of learning. 3) Controller: set up keyword filtering system, content scoring system, role co-validation system, and dynamic content correction system. This ensure academic strictness and pedagogical propriety of EZYer inputs and outputs. In order to evaluate EZYer, this paper designs five-dimensional evaluation indexes of content accuracy, knowledge coverage, usability, formatting correctness and visual design and appeal, and scores 100 Beamer and Notes generated by EZYer by five large language models, separately, and the results show that the quality of EZYer-generated content is excellent and has a good application prospect.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02555](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02555)
- **Abstract**:
> Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

- **Authors**: Songqiao Su , Xiaofei Sun , Xiaoya Li , Albert Wang , Jiwei Li , Chris Shum
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02551](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02551)
- **Abstract**:
> In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\it this http URL } to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\% over {\it this http URL } on average; +19.2\% over {\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\% over {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\% over the most competitive {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\%, +26.0\%, +22.4\%, and +15.9\% for {\it this http URL }, {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

## 51. AskNearby: An LLM-Based Application for Neighborhood Information Retrieval and Personalized Cognitive-Map Recommendations
- **Authors**: Luyao Niu , Zhicheng Deng , Boyang Li , Nuoxian Huang , Ruiqi Liu , Wenjia Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02502](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02502)
- **Abstract**:
> The "15-minute city" envisions neighborhoods where residents can meet daily needs via a short walk or bike ride. Realizing this vision requires not only physical proximity but also efficient and reliable access to information about nearby places, services, and events. Existing location-based systems, however, focus mainly on city-level tasks and neglect the spatial, temporal, and cognitive factors that shape localized decision-making. We conceptualize this gap as the Local Life Information Accessibility (LLIA) problem and introduce AskNearby, an AI-driven community application that unifies retrieval and recommendation within the 15-minute life circle. AskNearby integrates (i) a three-layer Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that synergizes graph-based, semantic-vector, and geographic retrieval with (ii) a cognitive-map model that encodes each user's neighborhood familiarity and preferences. Experiments on real-world community datasets demonstrate that AskNearby significantly outperforms LLM-based and map-based baselines in retrieval accuracy and recommendation quality, achieving robust performance in spatiotemporal grounding and cognitive-aware ranking. Real-world deployments further validate its effectiveness. By addressing the LLIA challenge, AskNearby empowers residents to more effectively discover local resources, plan daily activities, and engage in community life.

## 52. Masking Matters: Unlocking the Spatial Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs for 3D Scene-Language Understanding
- **Authors**: Yerim Jeon , Miso Lee , WonJun Moon , Jae-Pil Heo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02487](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02487)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

## 53. UCAgents: Unidirectional Convergence for Visual Evidence Anchored Multi-Agent Medical Decision-Making
- **Authors**: Qianhan Feng , Zhongzhen Huang , Yakun Zhu , Xiaofan Zhang , Qi Dou
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02485](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02485)
- **Abstract**:
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment. Code is available at this https URL .

## 54. When Refusals Fail: Unstable Safety Mechanisms in Long-Context LLM Agents
- **Authors**: Tsimur Hadeliya , Mohammad Ali Jauhar , Nidhi Sakpal , Diogo Cruz
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02445](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02445)
- **Abstract**:
> Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

## 55. Boosting Medical Vision-Language Pretraining via Momentum Self-Distillation under Limited Computing Resources
- **Authors**: Phuc Pham , Nhu Pham , Ngoc Quoc Ly
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02438](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02438)
- **Abstract**:
> In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at this https URL .

## 56. WorldMM: Dynamic Multimodal Memory Agent for Long Video Reasoning
- **Authors**: Woongyeong Yeo , Kangsan Kim , Jaehong Yoon , Sung Ju Hwang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02425](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02425)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

## 57. WISE: Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts for Robust Multimodal Multi-Agent Debate
- **Authors**: Anoop Cherian , River Doyle , Eyal Ben-Dov , Suhas Lohit , Kuan-Chuan Peng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02405](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02405)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

## 58. Process-Centric Analysis of Agentic Software Systems
- **Authors**: Shuyang Liu , Yang Chen , Rahul Krishna , Saurabh Sinha , Jatin Ganhotra , Reyhan Jabbarvand
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02393](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02393)
- **Abstract**:
> Agentic systems are modern software systems: they consist of orchestrated modules, expose interfaces, and are deployed in software pipelines. Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success. Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02363](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02363)
- **Abstract**:
> Domain-specific question answering (QA) systems for services face unique challenges in integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources while ensuring both accuracy and safety. Existing large language models often struggle with factual consistency and context alignment in sensitive domains such as healthcare policies and government welfare. In this work, we introduce Knowledge-Aware Reasoning and Memory-Augmented Adaptation (KARMA), a novel framework designed to enhance QA performance in care scenarios. KARMA incorporates a dual-encoder architecture to fuse structured and unstructured knowledge sources, a gated memory unit to dynamically regulate external knowledge integration, and a safety-aware controllable decoder that mitigates unsafe outputs using safety classification and guided generation techniques. Extensive experiments on a proprietary QA dataset demonstrate that KARMA outperforms strong baselines in both answer quality and safety. This study offers a comprehensive solution for building trustworthy and adaptive QA systems in service contexts.

- **Authors**: Zhengzhuo Xu , Chong Sun , SiNan Du , Chen Li , Jing Lyu , Chun Yuan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02361](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02361)
- **Abstract**:
> While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02318](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02318)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper studies how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) undermine the security guarantees of visual CAPTCHA. We identify the attack surface where an adversary can cheaply automate CAPTCHA solving using off-the-shelf models. We evaluate 7 leading commercial and open-source MLLMs across 18 real-world CAPTCHA task types, measuring single-shot accuracy, success under limited retries, end-to-end latency, and per-solve cost. We further analyze the impact of task-specific prompt engineering and few-shot demonstrations on solver effectiveness. We reveal that MLLMs can reliably solve recognition-oriented and low-interaction CAPTCHA tasks at human-like cost and latency, whereas tasks requiring fine-grained localization, multi-step spatial reasoning, or cross-frame consistency remain significantly harder for current models. By examining the reasoning traces of such MLLMs, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of why models succeed/fail on specific CAPTCHA puzzles and use these insights to derive defense-oriented guidelines for selecting and strengthening CAPTCHA tasks. We conclude by discussing implications for platform operators deploying CAPTCHA as part of their abuse-mitigation this http URL Availability ( this https URL ).

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02299)
- **Abstract**:
> How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

## 63. Progressive Image Restoration via Text-Conditioned Video Generation
- **Authors**: Peng Kang , Xijun Wang , Yu Yuan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02273](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02273)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

## 64. DETAIL Matters: Measuring the Impact of Prompt Specificity on Reasoning in Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Olivia Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02246](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02246)
- **Abstract**:
> Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks. Our results highlight the need for adaptive prompting strategies and provide tools and data to support further research.

- **Authors**: Le Thien Phuc Nguyen , Zhuoran Yu , Samuel Low Yu Hang , Subin An , Jeongik Lee , Yohan Ban , SeungEun Chung , Thanh-Huy Nguyen , JuWan Maeng , Soochahn Lee , Yong Jae Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02231](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02231)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

## 66. A Knowledge-Based Language Model: Deducing Grammatical Knowledge in a Multi-Agent Language Acquisition Simulation
- **Authors**: David Ph. Shakouri , Crit Cremers , Niels O. Schiller
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02195](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02195)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

- **Authors**: Ziyan Wang , Enmao Diao , Qi Le , Pu Wang , Guanchu Wang , Minwoo Lee , Shu-ping Yeh , Li Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02185](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02185)
- **Abstract**:
> Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) such as OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 deliver strong multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought generation, but their large model sizes and lengthy decode-time outputs make them costly to deploy and unsuitable for resource-constrained settings. To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.

- **Abstract**:
> Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots powered by a large language model (LLM) are entering young children's learning and play, yet little is known about how young children construe these agents or how such construals relate to engagement. We examined anthropomorphism of a social AI chatbot during collaborative storytelling and asked how children's attributions related to their behavior and prefrontal activation. Children at ages 5-6 (N = 23) completed three storytelling sessions: interacting with (1) an AI chatbot only, (2) a parent only, and (3) the AI and a parent together. After the sessions, children completed an interview assessing anthropomorphism toward both the AI chatbot and the parent. Behavioral engagement was indexed by the conversational turn count (CTC) ratio, and concurrent fNIRS measured oxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral vmPFC and dmPFC regions. Children reported higher anthropomorphism for parents than for the AI chatbot overall, although AI ratings were relatively high for perceptive abilities and epistemic states. Anthropomorphism was not associated with CTC. In the right dmPFC, higher perceptive scores were associated with greater activation during the AI-only condition and with lower activation during the AI+Parent condition. Exploratory analyses indicated that higher dmPFC activation during the AI-only condition correlated with higher end-of-session "scared" mood ratings. Findings suggest that stronger perceptive anthropomorphism can be associated with greater brain activation related to interpreting the AI's mental states, whereas parent co-presence may help some children interpret and regulate novel AI interactions. These results may have design implications for encouraging parent-AI co-use in early childhood.

## 69. Large Language Model based Smart Contract Auditing with LLMBugScanner
- **Authors**: Yining Yuan , Yifei Wang , Yichang Xu , Zachary Yahn , Sihao Hu , Ling Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02069](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02069)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper presents LLMBugScanner, a large language model (LLM) based framework for smart contract vulnerability detection using fine-tuning and ensemble learning. Smart contract auditing presents several challenges for LLMs: different pretrained models exhibit varying reasoning abilities, and no single model performs consistently well across all vulnerability types or contract structures. These limitations persist even after fine-tuning individual LLMs. To address these challenges, LLMBugScanner combines domain knowledge adaptation with ensemble reasoning to improve robustness and generalization. Through domain knowledge adaptation, we fine-tune LLMs on complementary datasets to capture both general code semantics and instruction-guided vulnerability reasoning, using parameter-efficient tuning to reduce computational cost. Through ensemble reasoning, we leverage the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs and apply a consensus-based conflict resolution strategy to produce more reliable vulnerability assessments. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple popular LLMs and compare LLMBugScanner with both pretrained and fine-tuned individual models. Results show that LLMBugScanner achieves consistent accuracy improvements and stronger generalization, demonstrating that it provides a principled, cost-effective, and extensible framework for smart contract auditing.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02056](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02056)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text generators into powerful problem solvers. Yet, many open tasks demand critical thinking, multi-source, and verifiable outputs, which are beyond single-shot prompting or standard retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, numerous studies have explored Deep Research (DR), which aims to combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools, such as search engines, thereby empowering LLMs to act as research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of deep research systems, including a clear roadmap, foundational components, practical implementation techniques, important challenges, and future directions. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we formalize a three-stage roadmap and distinguish deep research from related paradigms; (ii) we introduce four key components: query planning, information acquisition, memory management, and answer generation, each paired with fine-grained sub-taxonomies; (iii) we summarize optimization techniques, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning; and (iv) we consolidate evaluation criteria and open challenges, aiming to guide and facilitate future development. As the field of deep research continues to evolve rapidly, we are committed to continuously updating this survey to reflect the latest progress in this area.

## 72. Do Large Language Models Walk Their Talk? Measuring the Gap Between Implicit Associations, Self-Report, and Behavioral Altruism
- **Authors**: Sandro Andric
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01568](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01568)
- **Abstract**:
> We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

## 73. Graphing the Truth: Structured Visualizations for Automated Hallucination Detection in LLMs
- **Authors**: Tanmay Agrawal
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00663](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00663)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language. In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.
