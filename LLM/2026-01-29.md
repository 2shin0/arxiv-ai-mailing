- **Abstract**:
> Although the capabilities of large language models have been increasingly tested on complex reasoning tasks, their long-horizon planning abilities have not yet been extensively investigated. In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows for modest improvements, suggesting inherent architectural limitations which might not be overcome by test-time scaling approaches alone.

## 2. Deep Researcher with Sequential Plan Reflection and Candidates Crossover (Deep Researcher Reflect Evolve)
- **Authors**: Saurav Prateek
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20843](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20843)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper introduces a novel Deep Researcher architecture designed to generate detailed research reports on complex PhD level topics by addressing the inherent limitations of the Parallel Scaling paradigm. Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard. This performance marginally exceeds our previous work, Static DRA, and reinforces the finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self consistency paradigm.

## 3. MemCtrl: Using MLLMs as Active Memory Controllers on Embodied Agents
- **Authors**: Vishnu Sashank Dorbala , Dinesh Manocha
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20831](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20831)
- **Abstract**:
> Foundation models rely on in-context learning for personalized decision making. The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head \mu that acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of \mu, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on \mu-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that \mu-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by \mu, noting the superior performance of \mu augmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.

## 4. Investigating the Development of Task-Oriented Communication in Vision-Language Models
- **Authors**: Boaz Carmeli , Orr Paradise , Shafi Goldwasser , Yonatan Belinkov , Ron Meir
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20641](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20641)
- **Abstract**:
> We investigate whether \emph{LLM-based agents} can develop task-oriented communication protocols that differ from standard natural language in collaborative reasoning tasks. Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.

## 5. Dialogical Reasoning Across AI Architectures: A Multi-Model Framework for Testing AI Alignment Strategies
- **Authors**: Gray Cox
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20604](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20604)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper introduces a methodological framework for empirically testing AI alignment strategies through structured multi-model dialogue. Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning. Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange. Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of "VCW as transitional framework." Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers. The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.

## 6. PathWise: Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs
- **Authors**: Oguzhan Gungordu , Siheng Xiong , Faramarz Fekri
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20539](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20539)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.

## 7. CtrlCoT: Dual-Granularity Chain-of-Thought Compression for Controllable Reasoning
- **Authors**: Zhenxuan Fan , Jie Cao , Yang Dai , Zheqi Lv , Wenqiao Zhang , Zhongle Xie , Peng LU , Beng Chin Ooi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20467](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20467)
- **Abstract**:
> Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning. Our code will be publicly available at this https URL .

## 8. Policy of Thoughts: Scaling LLM Reasoning via Test-time Policy Evolution
- **Authors**: Zhengbo Jiao , Hongyu Xian , Qinglong Wang , Yunpu Ma , Zhebo Wang , Zifan Zhang , Dezhang Kong , Meng Han
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20379](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20379)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.

## 9. AMA: Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Authors**: Weiquan Huang , Zixuan Wang , Hehai Lin , Sudong Wang , Bo Xu , Qian Li , Beier Zhu , Linyi Yang , Chengwei Qin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20352](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20352)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has necessitated robust memory systems to support cohesive long-term interaction and complex reasoning. Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.

## 10. ECG-Agent: On-Device Tool-Calling Agent for ECG Multi-Turn Dialogue
- **Authors**: Hyunseung Chung , Jungwoo Oh , Daeun Kyung , Jiho Kim , Yeonsu Kwon , Min-Gyu Kim , Edward Choi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20323)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have rapidly expanded to electrocardiograms, focusing on classification, report generation, and single-turn QA tasks. However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy. Furthermore, on-device agents achieve comparable performance to larger agents in various evaluations that assess response accuracy, tool-calling ability, and hallucinations, demonstrating their viability for real-world applications.

## 11. Scaling Medical Reasoning Verification via Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning
- **Authors**: Hang Zhang , Ruheng Wang , Yuelyu Ji , Mingu Kwak , Xizhi Wu , Chenyu Li , Li Zhang , Wenqi Shi , Yifan Peng , Yanshan Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20221](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20221)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models have achieved strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, yet their deployment in clinical settings demands rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy. While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\method$ demonstrates an $\mathbf{8\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.

## 12. Towards Intelligent Urban Park Development Monitoring: LLM Agents for Multi-Modal Information Fusion and Analysis
- **Authors**: Zixuan Xiao , Chunguang Hu , Jun Ma
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20206](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20206)
- **Abstract**:
> As an important part of urbanization, the development monitoring of newly constructed parks is of great significance for evaluating the effect of urban planning and optimizing resource allocation. However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.

## 13. Should I Have Expressed a Different Intent? Counterfactual Generation for LLM-Based Autonomous Control
- **Authors**: Amirmohammad Farzaneh , Salvatore D'Oro , Osvaldo Simeone
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20090](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20090)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language model (LLM)-powered agents can translate high-level user intents into plans and actions in an environment. Yet after observing an outcome, users may wonder: What if I had phrased my intent differently? We introduce a framework that enables such counterfactual reasoning in agentic LLM-driven control scenarios, while providing formal reliability guarantees. Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction. Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines.

## 14. Insight Agents: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Data Insights
- **Authors**: Jincheng Bai , Zhenyu Zhang , Jennifer Zhang , Zhihuai Zhu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20048](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20048)
- **Abstract**:
> Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.

## 15. Fuzzy Categorical Planning: Autonomous Goal Satisfaction with Graded Semantic Constraints
- **Authors**: Shuhui Qu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20021)
- **Abstract**:
> Natural-language planning often involves vague predicates (e.g., suitable substitute, stable enough) whose satisfaction is inherently graded. Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners.

## 16. Teaching LLMs to Ask: Self-Querying Category-Theoretic Planning for Under-Specified Reasoning
- **Authors**: Shuhui Qu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20014](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20014)
- **Abstract**:
> Inference-time planning with large language models frequently breaks under partial observability: when task-critical preconditions are not specified at query time, models tend to hallucinate missing facts or produce plans that violate hard constraints. We introduce \textbf{Self-Querying Bidirectional Categorical Planning (SQ-BCP)}, which explicitly represents precondition status (\texttt{Sat}/\texttt{Viol}/\texttt{Unk}) and resolves unknowns via (i) targeted self-queries to an oracle/user or (ii) \emph{bridging} hypotheses that establish the missing condition through an additional action. SQ-BCP performs bidirectional search and invokes a pullback-based verifier as a categorical certificate of goal compatibility, while using distance-based scores only for ranking and pruning. We prove that when the verifier succeeds and hard constraints pass deterministic checks, accepted plans are compatible with goal requirements; under bounded branching and finite resolution depth, SQ-BCP finds an accepting plan when one exists. Across WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks with withheld preconditions, SQ-BCP reduces resource-violation rates to \textbf{14.9\%} and \textbf{5.8\%} (vs.\ \textbf{26.0\%} and \textbf{15.7\%} for the best baseline), while maintaining competitive reference quality.

## 17. Reward Models Inherit Value Biases from Pretraining
- **Authors**: Brian Christian , Jessica A. F. Thompson , Elle Michelle Yang , Vincent Adam , Hannah Rose Kirk , Christopher Summerfield , Tsvetomira Dumbalska
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20838](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20838)
- **Abstract**:
> Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values but have received less attention than pre-trained and post-trained LLMs themselves. Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the "Big Two" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for "agency" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for "communion." This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.

## 18. Open-Vocabulary Functional 3D Human-Scene Interaction Generation
- **Authors**: Jie Liu , Yu Sun , Alpar Cseke , Yao Feng , Nicolas Heron , Michael J. Black , Yan Zhang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20835](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20835)
- **Abstract**:
> Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as "sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., "increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

## 19. Training Reasoning Models on Saturated Problems via Failure-Prefix Conditioning
- **Authors**: Minwu Kim , Safal Shrestha , Keith Ross
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20829](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20829)
- **Abstract**:
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.

## 20. Reinforcement Learning via Self-Distillation
- **Authors**: Jonas Hübotter , Frederike Lübeck , Lejs Behric , Anton Baumann , Marco Bagatella , Daniel Marta , Ido Hakimi , Idan Shenfeld , Thomas Kleine Buening , Carlos Guestrin , Andreas Krause
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20802](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20802)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models are increasingly post-trained with reinforcement learning in verifiable domains such as code and math. Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.

## 21. HESTIA: A Hessian-Guided Differentiable Quantization-Aware Training Framework for Extremely Low-Bit LLMs
- **Authors**: Guoan Wang , Feiyu Wang , Zongwei Lv , Yikun Zong , Tong Yang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20745](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20745)
- **Abstract**:
> As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, deployment is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory wall, motivating a shift toward extremely low-bit quantization. However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models. These results indicate that Hessian-guided relaxation effectively recovers representational capacity, establishing a more robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs. The code is available at this https URL .

## 22. QueerGen: How LLMs Reflect Societal Norms on Gender and Sexuality in Sentence Completion Tasks
- **Authors**: Mae Sosto , Delfina Sol Martinez Pandiani , Laura Hollink
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20731](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20731)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce societal norms, particularly heterocisnormativity, and how these norms translate into measurable biases in their text generations. We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized "unmarked" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.

- **Authors**: Binglei Lou , Haoran Wu , Yao Lai , Jiayi Nie , Can Xiao , Xuan Guo , Rika Antonova , Robert Mullins , Aaron Zhao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20706](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20706)
- **Abstract**:
> Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduce iterative denoising to enable parallel token generation, but their sampling phase displays fundamentally different characteristics compared to GEMM-centric transformer layers. Profiling on modern GPUs reveals that sampling can account for up to 70% of total model inference latency-primarily due to substantial memory loads and writes from vocabulary-wide logits, reduction-based token selection, and iterative masked updates. These processes demand large on-chip SRAM and involve irregular memory accesses that conventional NPUs struggle to handle efficiently. To address this, we identify a set of critical instructions that an NPU architecture must specifically optimize for dLLM sampling. Our design employs lightweight non-GEMM vector primitives, in-place memory reuse strategies, and a decoupled mixed-precision memory hierarchy. Together, these optimizations deliver up to a 2.53x speedup over the NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU under an equivalent nm technology node. We also open-source our cycle-accurate simulation and post-synthesis RTL verification code, confirming functional equivalence with current dLLM PyTorch implementations.

## 24. LEMON: How Well Do MLLMs Perform Temporal Multimodal Understanding on Instructional Videos?
- **Authors**: Zhuang Yu , Lei Shen , Jing Zhao , Shiliang Sun
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20705](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20705)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress across vision, audio, and language tasks, yet their performance on long-form, knowledge-intensive, and temporally structured educational content remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LEMON, a Lecture-based Evaluation benchmark for MultimOdal uNderstanding, focusing on STEM lecture videos that require long-horizon reasoning and cross-modal integration. LEMON comprises 2,277 video segments spanning 5 disciplines and 29 courses, with an average duration of 196.1 seconds, yielding 4,181 high-quality QA pairs, including 3,413 multiple-choice and 768 open-ended questions. Distinct from existing video benchmarks, LEMON features: (1) semantic richness and disciplinary density, (2) tightly coupled video-audio-text modalities, (3) explicit temporal and pedagogical structure, and (4) contextually linked multi-turn questioning. It further encompasses six major tasks and twelve subtasks, covering the full cognitive spectrum from perception to reasoning and then to generation. Comprehensive experiments reveal substantial performance gaps across tasks, highlighting that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle with temporal reasoning and instructional prediction. We expect LEMON to serve as an extensible and challenging benchmark for advancing multimodal perception, reasoning, and generation in long-form instructional contents.

## 25. Decoupling Perception and Calibration: Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework
- **Authors**: Xinyue Li , Zhichao Zhang , Zhiming Xu , Shubo Xu , Xiongkuo Min , Yitong Chen , Guangtao Zhai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20689](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20689)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in image quality assessment (IQA) tasks. However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations. Experiments on both user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations, making lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets.

## 26. Harnessing Large Language Models for Precision Querying and Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Extraction in Clinical Data Science
- **Authors**: Juan Jose Rubio Jan , Jack Wu , Julia Ive
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20674](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20674)
- **Abstract**:
> This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to two foundational Electronic Health Record (EHR) data science tasks: structured data querying (using programmatic languages, Python/Pandas) and information extraction from unstructured clinical text via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We test the ability of LLMs to interact accurately with large structured datasets for analytics and the reliability of LLMs in extracting semantically correct information from free text health records when supported by RAG. To this end, we presented a flexible evaluation framework that automatically generates synthetic question and answer pairs tailored to the characteristics of each dataset or task. Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to support precise querying and accurate information extraction in clinical workflows.

## 27. GDCNet: Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection
- **Authors**: Shuguang Zhang , Junhong Lian , Guoxin Yu , Baoxun Xu , Xiang Ao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20618](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20618)
- **Abstract**:
> Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within image-text pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20617](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20617)
- **Abstract**:
> Deploying Large Language Model-based agents (LLM agents) in the public sector requires assuring that they meet the stringent legal, procedural, and structural requirements of public-sector institutions. Practitioners and researchers often turn to benchmarks for such assessments. However, it remains unclear what criteria benchmarks must meet to ensure they adequately reflect public-sector requirements, or how many existing benchmarks do so. In this paper, we first define such criteria based on a first-principles survey of public administration literature: benchmarks must be \emph{process-based}, \emph{realistic}, \emph{public-sector-specific} and report \emph{metrics} that reflect the unique requirements of the public sector. We analyse more than 1,300 benchmark papers for these criteria using an expert-validated LLM-assisted pipeline. Our results show that no single benchmark meets all of the criteria. Our findings provide a call to action for both researchers to develop public sector-relevant benchmarks and for public-sector officials to apply these criteria when evaluating their own agentic use cases.

## 29. Interpreting Emergent Extreme Events in Multi-Agent Systems

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20538](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20538)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language model-powered multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex human-like systems. The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20510](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20510)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems have substantially increased the realism of synthetic speech, raising new challenges for audio deepfake detection. This work presents a comparative evaluation of three state-of-the-art TTS models--Dia2, Maya1, and MeloTTS--representing streaming, LLM-based, and non-autoregressive architectures. A corpus of 12,000 synthetic audio samples was generated using the Daily-Dialog dataset and evaluated against four detection frameworks, including semantic, structural, and signal-level approaches. The results reveal significant variability in detector performance across generative mechanisms: models effective against one TTS architecture may fail against others, particularly LLM-based synthesis. In contrast, a multi-view detection approach combining complementary analysis levels demonstrates robust performance across all evaluated models. These findings highlight the limitations of single-paradigm detectors and emphasize the necessity of integrated detection strategies to address the evolving landscape of audio deepfake threats.

- **Authors**: Yuhao Sun , Chengyi Cai , Jiacheng Zhang , Zesheng Ye , Xingliang Yuan , Feng Liu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20419](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20419)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent research has shown that aligning fine-grained text descriptions with localized image patches can significantly improve the zero-shot performance of pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, we find that both fine-grained text descriptions and localized image patches often contain redundant information, making text-visual alignment less effective. In this paper, we tackle this issue from two perspectives: \emph{View Refinement} and \emph{Description refinement}, termed as \textit{\textbf{Bi}-refinement for \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{T}ext-visual \textbf{A}lignment} (BiFTA). \emph{View refinement} removes redundant image patches with high \emph{Intersection over Union} (IoU) ratios, resulting in more distinctive visual samples. \emph{Description refinement} removes redundant text descriptions with high pairwise cosine similarity, ensuring greater diversity in the remaining descriptions. BiFTA achieves superior zero-shot performance on 6 benchmark datasets for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP, justifying the necessity to remove redundant information in visual-text alignment.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20408](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20408)
- **Abstract**:
> Enterprise LLM deployment faces a critical scalability challenge: organizations must optimize models systematically to scale AI initiatives within constrained compute budgets, yet the specialized expertise required for manual optimization remains a niche and scarce skillset. This challenge is particularly evident in managing GPU utilization across heterogeneous infrastructure while enabling teams with diverse workloads and limited LLM optimization experience to deploy models efficiently. We present OptiKIT, a distributed LLM optimization framework that democratizes model compression and tuning by automating complex optimization workflows for non-expert teams. OptiKIT provides dynamic resource allocation, staged pipeline execution with automatic cleanup, and seamless enterprise integration. In production, it delivers more than 2x GPU throughput improvement while empowering application teams to achieve consistent performance improvements without deep LLM optimization expertise. We share both the platform design and key engineering insights into resource allocation algorithms, pipeline orchestration, and integration patterns that enable large-scale, production-grade democratization of model optimization. Finally, we open-source the system to enable external contributions and broader reproducibility.

## 33. GuideAI: A Real-time Personalized Learning Solution with Adaptive Interventions
- **Authors**: Ananya Shukla , Chaitanya Modi , Satvik Bajpai , Siddharth Siddharth
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20402](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20402)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful learning tools, but they lack awareness of learners' cognitive and physiological states, limiting their adaptability to the user's learning style. Contemporary learning techniques primarily focus on structured learning paths, knowledge tracing, and generic adaptive testing but fail to address real-time learning challenges driven by cognitive load, attention fluctuations, and engagement levels. Building on findings from a formative user study (N=66), we introduce GuideAI, a multi-modal framework that enhances LLM-driven learning by integrating real-time biosensory feedback including eye gaze tracking, heart rate variability, posture detection, and digital note-taking behavior. GuideAI dynamically adapts learning content and pacing through cognitive optimizations (adjusting complexity based on learning progress markers), physiological interventions (breathing guidance and posture correction), and attention-aware strategies (redirecting focus using gaze analysis). Additionally, GuideAI supports diverse learning modalities, including text-based, image-based, audio-based, and video-based instruction, across varied knowledge domains. A preliminary study (N = 25) assessed GuideAI's impact on knowledge retention and cognitive load through standardized assessments. The results show statistically significant improvements in both problem-solving capability and recall-based knowledge assessments. Participants also experienced notable reductions in key NASA-TLX measures including mental demand, frustration levels, and effort, while simultaneously reporting enhanced perceived performance. These findings demonstrate GuideAI's potential to bridge the gap between current LLM-based learning systems and individualized learner needs, paving the way for adaptive, cognition-aware education at scale.

## 34. LLM-AutoDP: Automatic Data Processing via LLM Agents for Model Fine-tuning
- **Authors**: Wei Huang , Anda Cheng , Yinggui Wang , Lei Wang , Tao Wei
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20375](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20375)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20346](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20346)
- **Abstract**:
> Ransomware has become one of the most serious cybersecurity threats causing major financial losses and operational disruptions this http URL detection methods such as static analysis, heuristic scanning and behavioral analysis often fall short when used alone. To address these limitations, this paper presents multimodal multi agent ransomware analysis framework designed for ransomware classification. Proposed multimodal multiagent architecture combines information from static, dynamic and network sources. Each data type is handled by specialized agent that uses auto encoder based feature extraction. These representations are then integrated through a fusion agent. After that fused representation are used by transformer based classifier. It identifies the specific ransomware family. The agents interact through an interagent feedback mechanism that iteratively refines feature representations by suppressing low confidence information. The framework was evaluated on large scale datasets containing thousands of ransomware and benign samples. Multiple experiments were conducted on ransomware dataset. It outperforms single modality and nonadaptive fusion baseline achieving improvement of up to 0.936 in Macro-F1 for family classification and reducing calibration error. Over 100 epochs, the agentic feedback loop displays a stable monotonic convergence leading to over +0.75 absolute improvement in terms of agent quality and a final composite score of around 0.88 without fine tuning of the language models. Zeroday ransomware detection remains family dependent on polymorphism and modality disruptions. Confidence aware abstention enables reliable real world deployment by favoring conservativeand trustworthy decisions over forced classification. The findings indicate that proposed approach provides a practical andeffective path toward improving real world ransomware defense systems.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20334](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20334)
- **Abstract**:
> Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models. Code is available at this https URL

## 37. Beyond Speedup -- Utilizing KV Cache for Sampling and Reasoning

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20326](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20326)
- **Abstract**:
> KV caches, typically used only to speed up autoregressive decoding, encode contextual information that can be reused for downstream tasks at no extra cost. We propose treating the KV cache as a lightweight representation, eliminating the need to recompute or store full hidden states. Despite being weaker than dedicated embeddings, KV-derived representations are shown to be sufficient for two key applications: \textbf{(i) Chain-of-Embedding}, where they achieve competitive or superior performance on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct; and \textbf{(ii) Fast/Slow Thinking Switching}, where they enable adaptive reasoning on Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distil-Qwen-14B, reducing token generation by up to $5.7\times$ with minimal accuracy loss. Our findings establish KV caches as a free, effective substrate for sampling and reasoning, opening new directions for representation reuse in LLM inference. Code: this https URL .

- **Abstract**:
> The global shortage and uneven distribution of medical expertise continue to hinder equitable access to accurate diagnostic care. While existing intelligent diagnostic system have shown promise, most struggle with dual-user interaction, and dynamic knowledge integration -- limiting their real-world applicability. In this study, we present DiagLink, a dual-user diagnostic assistance system that synergizes large language models (LLMs), knowledge graphs (KGs), and medical experts to support both patients and physicians. DiagLink uses guided dialogues to elicit patient histories, leverages LLMs and KGs for collaborative reasoning, and incorporates physician oversight for continuous knowledge validation and evolution. The system provides a role-adaptive interface, dynamically visualized history, and unified multi-source evidence to improve both trust and usability. We evaluate DiagLink through user study, use cases and expert interviews, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user satisfaction and diagnostic efficiency, while offering insights for the design of future AI-assisted diagnostic systems.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20309)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Model (LLM) serving faces a fundamental tension between stringent latency Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and limited GPU memory capacity. When high request rates exhaust the KV cache budget, existing LLM inference systems often suffer severe head-of-line (HOL) blocking. While prior work explored PCIe-based offloading, these approaches cannot sustain responsiveness under high request rates, often failing to meet tight Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) SLOs. We present SuperInfer, a high-performance LLM inference system designed for emerging Superchips (e.g., NVIDIA GH200) with tightly coupled GPU-CPU architecture via NVLink-C2C. SuperInfer introduces RotaSched, the first proactive, SLO-aware rotary scheduler that rotates requests to maintain responsiveness on Superchips, and DuplexKV, an optimized rotation engine that enables full-duplex transfer over NVLink-C2C. Evaluations on GH200 using various models and datasets show that SuperInfer improves TTFT SLO attainment rates by up to 74.7% while maintaining comparable TBT and throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating that SLO-aware scheduling and memory co-design unlocks the full potential of Superchips for responsive LLM serving.

## 40. Physically Guided Visual Mass Estimation from a Single RGB Image
- **Authors**: Sungjae Lee , Junhan Jeong , Yeonjoo Hong , Kwang In Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20303](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20303)
- **Abstract**:
> Estimating object mass from visual input is challenging because mass depends jointly on geometric volume and material-dependent density, neither of which is directly observable from RGB appearance. Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision. Experiments on image2mass and ABO-500 show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

## 41. Truthfulness Despite Weak Supervision: Evaluating and Training LLMs Using Peer Prediction
- **Authors**: Tianyi Alex Qiu , Micah Carroll , Cameron Allen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20299)
- **Abstract**:
> The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.

## 42. Beyond the Needle's Illusion: Decoupled Evaluation of Evidence Access and Use under Semantic Interference at 326M-Token Scale
- **Authors**: Tianwei Lin , Zuyi Zhou , Xinda Zhao , Chenke Wang , Xiaohong Li , Yu Chen , Chuanrui Hu , Jian Pei , Yafeng Deng
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20276](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20276)
- **Abstract**:
> Long-context LLM agents must access the right evidence from large environments and use it faithfully. However, the popular Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation mostly measures benign span localization. The needle is near-unique, and the haystack is largely irrelevant. We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap. Systems that saturate benign NIAH degrade sharply in evidence access under semantic interference. These results indicate that semantic discrimination, not context length alone, is the dominant bottleneck for long-context memory at scale.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20270](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20270)
- **Abstract**:
> Phishing continues to be one of the most prevalent attack vectors, making accurate classification of phishing URLs essential. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising results in phishing URL detection. However, their reasoning capabilities that enabled such performance remain underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Least-to-Most prompting framework for phishing URL detection. In particular, we introduce an "answer sensitivity" mechanism that guides Least-to-Most's iterative approach to enhance reasoning and yield higher prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing against a one-shot approach and a supervised model. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the one-shot baseline while achieving performance comparable to that of the supervised model, despite requiring significantly less training data. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis highlights how the iterative reasoning enabled by Least-to-Most, and reinforced by our answer sensitivity mechanism, drives these performance gains. Overall, we show that this simple yet powerful prompting strategy consistently outperforms both one-shot and supervised approaches, despite requiring minimal training or few-shot guidance. Our experimental setup can be found in our Github repository this http URL .

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20253](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20253)
- **Abstract**:
> Open-ended question answering (QA) evaluates a model's ability to perform contextualized reasoning beyond factual recall. This challenge is especially acute in practice-based domains, where knowledge is procedural and grounded in professional judgment, while most existing LLM benchmarks depend on pre-existing human exam datasets that are often unavailable in such settings. We introduce a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert-authored guidelines informed by Bloom's Taxonomy. It converts expert practices into implicit violation-based scenarios and expands them into auto-graded multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and multi-turn dialogues across four cognitive levels, enabling deterministic, reproducible, and scalable evaluation. Applied to three applied domains: teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, we find differences between model and human-like reasoning: LLMs sometimes perform relatively better on higher-order reasoning (Analyze) but fail more frequently on lower-level items (Remember). We produce large-scale, psychometrically informed benchmarks that surface these non-intuitive model behaviors and enable evaluation of contextualized reasoning in real-world settings.

- **Abstract**:
> The scaling law, which indicates that model performance improves with increasing dataset and model capacity, has fueled a growing trend in expanding recommendation models in both industry and academia. However, the advent of large-scale recommenders also brings significantly higher computational costs, particularly under the long-sequence dependencies inherent in the user intent of recommendation systems. Current approaches often rely on pre-storing the intermediate states of the past behavior for each user, thereby reducing the quadratic re-computation cost for the following requests. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often treat memory merely as a medium for acceleration, without adequately considering the space overhead it introduces. This presents a critical challenge in real-world recommendation systems with billions of users, each of whom might initiate thousands of interactions and require massive memory for state storage. Fortunately, there have been several memory management strategies examined for compression in LLM, while most have not been evaluated on the recommendation task. To mitigate this gap, we introduce MALLOC, a comprehensive benchmark for memory-aware long sequence compression. MALLOC presents a comprehensive investigation and systematic classification of memory management techniques applicable to large sequential recommendations. These techniques are integrated into state-of-the-art recommenders, enabling a reproducible and accessible evaluation platform. Through extensive experiments across accuracy, efficiency, and complexity, we demonstrate the holistic reliability of MALLOC in advancing large-scale recommendation.

## 46. What's the plan? Metrics for implicit planning in LLMs and their application to rhyme generation and question answering
- **Authors**: Jim Maar , Denis Paperno , Callum Stuart McDougall , Neel Nanda
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20164](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20164)
- **Abstract**:
> Prior work suggests that language models, while trained on next token prediction, show implicit planning behavior: they may select the next token in preparation to a predicted future token, such as a likely rhyming word, as supported by a prior qualitative study of Claude 3.5 Haiku using a cross-layer transcoder. We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. "-ight") or answer to a question ("whale") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters. Our methodology offers a widely applicable direct way to study implicit planning abilities of LLMs. More broadly, understanding planning abilities of language models can inform decisions in AI safety and control.

## 47. Large language models accurately predict public perceptions of support for climate action worldwide
- **Authors**: Nattavudh Powdthavee , Sandra J. Geiger
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20141](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20141)
- **Abstract**:
> Although most people support climate action, widespread underestimation of others' support stalls individual and systemic changes. In this preregistered experiment, we test whether large language models (LLMs) can reliably predict these perception gaps worldwide. Using country-level indicators and public opinion data from 125 countries, we benchmark four state-of-the-art LLMs against Gallup World Poll 2021/22 data and statistical regressions. LLMs, particularly Claude, accurately capture public perceptions of others' willingness to contribute financially to climate action (MAE approximately 5 p.p.; r = .77), comparable to statistical models, though performance declines in less digitally connected, lower-GDP countries. Controlled tests show that LLMs capture the key psychological process - social projection with a systematic downward bias - and rely on structured reasoning rather than memorized values. Overall, LLMs provide a rapid tool for assessing perception gaps in climate action, serving as an alternative to costly surveys in resource-rich countries and as a complement in underrepresented populations.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20126](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20126)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or unverifiable content, undermining their reliability in factual domains. This work investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a training paradigm that explicitly rewards abstention ("I don't know") alongside correctness to promote intellectual humility. We fine-tune and evaluate Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on the MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks using a ternary reward structure ($-1$, r_abs, 1) under varying abstention reward structures. We further study the effect of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning strategies that teach abstention prior to reinforcement learning. Our results show that moderate abstention rewards (r_abs $\approx -0.25$ to 0.3) consistently reduce incorrect responses without severe accuracy degradation on multiple-choice tasks, with larger models exhibiting greater robustness to abstention incentives. On open-ended question answering, we observe limitations due to insufficient exploration, which can be partially mitigated through supervised abstention training. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of verifiable reward design as a practical approach for hallucination mitigation in language models. Reproducible code for our abstention training framework is available here this https URL .

## 49. Membership Inference Attacks Against Fine-tuned Diffusion Language Models
- **Authors**: Yuetian Chen , Kaiyuan Zhang , Yuntao Du , Edoardo Stoppa , Charles Fleming , Ashish Kundu , Bruno Ribeiro , Ninghui Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20125](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20125)
- **Abstract**:
> Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) represent a promising alternative to autoregressive language models, using bidirectional masked token prediction. Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.

## 50. Dynamics of Human-AI Collective Knowledge on the Web: A Scalable Model and Insights for Sustainable Growth
- **Authors**: Buddhika Nettasinghe , Kang Zhao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20099)
- **Abstract**:
> Humans and large language models (LLMs) now co-produce and co-consume the web's shared knowledge archives. Such human-AI collective knowledge ecosystems contain feedback loops with both benefits (e.g., faster growth, easier learning) and systemic risks (e.g., quality dilution, skill reduction, model collapse). To understand such phenomena, we propose a minimal, interpretable dynamical model of the co-evolution of archive size, archive quality, model (LLM) skill, aggregate human skill, and query volume. The model captures two content inflows (human, LLM) controlled by a gate on LLM-content admissions, two learning pathways for humans (archive study vs. LLM assistance), and two LLM-training modalities (corpus-driven scaling vs. learning from human feedback). Through numerical experiments, we identify different growth regimes (e.g., healthy growth, inverted flow, inverted learning, oscillations), and show how platform and policy levers (gate strictness, LLM training, human learning pathways) shift the system across regime boundaries. Two domain configurations (PubMed, GitHub and Copilot) illustrate contrasting steady states under different growth rates and moderation norms. We also fit the model to Wikipedia's knowledge flow during pre-ChatGPT and post-ChatGPT eras separately. We find a rise in LLM additions with a concurrent decline in human inflow, consistent with a regime identified by the model. Our model and analysis yield actionable insights for sustainable growth of human-AI collective knowledge on the Web.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20083](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20083)
- **Abstract**:
> We present LLaTTE (LLM-Style Latent Transformers for Temporal Events), a scalable transformer architecture for production ads recommendation. Through systematic experiments, we demonstrate that sequence modeling in recommendation systems follows predictable power-law scaling similar to LLMs. Crucially, we find that semantic features bend the scaling curve: they are a prerequisite for scaling, enabling the model to effectively utilize the capacity of deeper and longer architectures. To realize the benefits of continued scaling under strict latency constraints, we introduce a two-stage architecture that offloads the heavy computation of large, long-context models to an asynchronous upstream user model. We demonstrate that upstream improvements transfer predictably to downstream ranking tasks. Deployed as the largest user model at Meta, this multi-stage framework drives a 4.3\% conversion uplift on Facebook Feed and Reels with minimal serving overhead, establishing a practical blueprint for harnessing scaling laws in industrial recommender systems.

## 52. VERGE: Formal Refinement and Guidance Engine for Verifiable LLM Reasoning
- **Authors**: Vikash Singh , Darion Cassel , Nathaniel Weir , Nick Feng , Sam Bayless
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20055](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20055)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite the syntactic fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their logical correctness in high-stakes domains remains a fundamental challenge. We present a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with SMT solvers to produce verification-guided answers through iterative refinement. Our approach decomposes LLM outputs into atomic claims, autoformalizes them into first-order logic, and verifies their logical consistency using automated theorem proving. We introduce three key innovations: (1) multi-model consensus via formal semantic equivalence checking to ensure logic-level alignment between candidates, eliminating the syntactic bias of surface-form metrics, (2) semantic routing that directs different claim types to appropriate verification strategies: symbolic solvers for logical claims and LLM ensembles for commonsense reasoning, and (3) precise logical error localization via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the exact subset of claims to revise, transforming binary failure signals into actionable feedback. Our framework classifies claims by their logical status and aggregates multiple verification signals into a unified score with variance-based penalty. The system iteratively refines answers using structured feedback until acceptance criteria are met or convergence is achieved. This hybrid approach delivers formal guarantees where possible and consensus verification elsewhere, advancing trustworthy AI. With the GPT-OSS-120B model, VERGE demonstrates an average performance uplift of 18.7% at convergence across a set of reasoning benchmarks compared to single-pass approaches.

## 53. CiMRAG: Cim-Aware Domain-Adaptive and Noise-Resilient Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Edge-Based LLMs
- **Authors**: Shih-Hsuan Chiu , Ming-Syan Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20041](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20041)
- **Abstract**:
> Personalized virtual assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) on edge devices are attracting growing attention, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a key method for personalization by retrieving relevant profile data and generating tailored responses. However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on personalization benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods relative to strong baselines, especially in task-specific noisy scenarios.

## 54. LinguaMap: Which Layers of LLMs Speak Your Language and How to Tune Them?
- **Authors**: J. Ben Tamo , Daniel Carlander-Reuterfelt , Jonathan Rubin , Dezhi Hong , Mingxian Wang , Oleg Poliannikov
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20009](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20009)
- **Abstract**:
> Despite multilingual pretraining, large language models often struggle with non-English tasks, particularly in language control, the ability to respond in the intended language. We identify and characterize two key failure modes: the multilingual transfer bottleneck (correct language, incorrect task response) and the language consistency bottleneck (correct task response, wrong language). To systematically surface these issues, we design a four-scenario evaluation protocol spanning MMLU, MGSM, and XQuAD benchmarks. To probe these issues with interpretability, we extend logit lens analysis to track language probabilities layer by layer and compute cross-lingual semantic similarity of hidden states. The results reveal a three-phase internal structure: early layers align inputs into a shared semantic space, middle layers perform task reasoning, and late layers drive language-specific generation. Guided by these insights, we introduce selective fine-tuning of only the final layers responsible for language control. On Qwen-3-32B and Bloom-7.1B, this method achieves over 98 percent language consistency across six languages while fine-tuning only 3-5 percent of parameters, without sacrificing task accuracy. Importantly, this result is nearly identical to that of full-scope fine-tuning (for example, above 98 percent language consistency for both methods across all prompt scenarios) but uses a fraction of the computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage layer-localization of language control for efficient multilingual adaptation.

## 55. On the Effectiveness of LLM-Specific Fine-Tuning for Detecting AI-Generated Text
- **Authors**: Michał Gromadzki , Anna Wróblewska , Agnieszka Kaliska
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20006](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20006)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid progress of large language models has enabled the generation of text that closely resembles human writing, creating challenges for authenticity verification in education, publishing, and digital security. Detecting AI-generated text has therefore become a crucial technical and ethical issue. This paper presents a comprehensive study of AI-generated text detection based on large-scale corpora and novel training strategies. We introduce a 1-billion-token corpus of human-authored texts spanning multiple genres and a 1.9-billion-token corpus of AI-generated texts produced by prompting a variety of LLMs across diverse domains. Using these resources, we develop and evaluate numerous detection models and propose two novel training paradigms: Per LLM and Per LLM family fine-tuning. Across a 100-million-token benchmark covering 21 large language models, our best fine-tuned detector achieves up to $99.6\%$ token-level accuracy, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines.

## 56. VoxPrivacy: A Benchmark for Evaluating Interactional Privacy of Speech Language Models
- **Authors**: Yuxiang Wang , Hongyu Liu , Dekun Chen , Xueyao Zhang , Zhizheng Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19956](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19956)
- **Abstract**:
> As Speech Language Models (SLMs) transition from personal devices to shared, multi-user environments such as smart homes, a new challenge emerges: the model is expected to distinguish between users to manage information flow appropriately. Without this capability, an SLM could reveal one user's confidential schedule to another, a privacy failure we term interactional privacy. Thus, the ability to generate speaker-aware responses becomes essential for SLM safe deployment. Current SLM benchmarks test dialogue ability but overlook speaker identity. Multi-speaker benchmarks check who said what without assessing whether SLMs adapt their responses. Privacy benchmarks focus on globally sensitive data (e.g., bank passwords) while neglecting contextual privacy-sensitive information (e.g., a user's private appointment). To address this gap, we introduce VoxPrivacy, the first benchmark designed to evaluate interactional privacy in SLMs. VoxPrivacy spans three tiers of increasing difficulty, from following direct secrecy commands to proactively protecting privacy. Our evaluation of nine SLMs on a 32-hour bilingual dataset reveals a widespread vulnerability: most open-source models perform close to random chance (around 50% accuracy) on conditional privacy decisions, while even strong closed-source systems fall short on proactive privacy inference. We further validate these findings on Real-VoxPrivacy, a human-recorded subset, confirming that failures observed on synthetic data persist in real speech. Finally, we demonstrate a viable path forward: by fine-tuning on a new 4,000-hour training set, we improve privacy-preserving abilities while maintaining robustness. To support future work, we release the VoxPrivacy benchmark, the large-scale training set, and the fine-tuned model to foster the development of safer and more context-aware SLMs.

## 57. LTS-VoiceAgent: A Listen-Think-Speak Framework for Efficient Streaming Voice Interaction via Semantic Triggering and Incremental Reasoning
- **Authors**: Wenhao Zou , Yuwei Miao , Zhanyu Ma , Jun Xu , Jiuchong Gao , Jinghua Hao , Renqing He , Jingwen Xu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19952)
- **Abstract**:
> Real-time voice agents face a dilemma: end-to-end models often lack deep reasoning, while cascaded pipelines incur high latency by executing ASR, LLM reasoning, and TTS strictly in sequence, unlike human conversation where listeners often start thinking before the speaker finishes. Since cascaded architectures remain the dominant choice for complex tasks, existing cascaded streaming strategies attempt to reduce this latency via mechanical segmentation (e.g., fixed chunks, VAD-based splitting) or speculative generation, but they frequently either break semantic units or waste computation on predictions that must be rolled back. To address these challenges, we propose LTS-VoiceAgent, a Listen-Think-Speak framework that explicitly separates when to think from how to reason incrementally. It features a Dynamic Semantic Trigger to detect meaningful prefixes, and a Dual-Role Stream Orchestrator that coordinates a background Thinker (for state maintenance) and a foreground Speaker (for speculative solving). This parallel design enables "thinking while speaking" without blocking responses. We also introduce a Pause-and-Repair benchmark containing natural disfluencies to stress-test streaming robustness. Experiments across VERA, Spoken-MQA, BigBenchAudio, and our benchmark show that LTS-VoiceAgent achieves a stronger accuracy-latency-efficiency trade-off than serial cascaded baselines and existing streaming strategies.

## 58. Bench4HLS: End-to-End Evaluation of LLMs in High-Level Synthesis Code Generation
- **Authors**: M Zafir Sadik Khan , Kimia Azar , Hadi Kamali
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19941)
- **Abstract**:
> In last two years, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code generation, including hardware design at register-transfer level (RTL). While their use in high-level synthesis (HLS) remains comparatively less mature, the ratio of HLS- to RTL-focused studies has shifted from 1:10 to 2:10 in the past six months, indicating growing interest in leveraging LLMs for high-level design entry while relying on downstream synthesis for optimization. This growing trend highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation framework dedicated to LLM-based HLS. To address this, We present Bench4HLS for evaluating LLM-generated HLS designs. Bench4HLS comprises 170 manually drafted and validated case studies, spanning small kernels to complex accelerators, curated from widely used public repositories. The framework supports fully automated assessment of compilation success, functional correctness via simulation, and synthesis feasibility/optimization. Crucially, Bench4HLS integrates a pluggable API for power, performance, and area (PPA) analysis across various HLS toolchains and architectures, demonstrated here with Xilinx Vitis HLS and validated on Catapult HLS. By providing a structured, extensible, and plug-and-play testbed, Bench4HLS establishes a foundational methodology for benchmarking LLMs in HLS workflows.

## 59. Gap-K%: Measuring Top-1 Prediction Gap for Detecting Pretraining Data
- **Authors**: Minseo Kwak , Jaehyung Kim
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19936)
- **Abstract**:
> The opacity of massive pretraining corpora in Large Language Models (LLMs) raises significant privacy and copyright concerns, making pretraining data detection a critical challenge. Existing state-of-the-art methods typically rely on token likelihoods, yet they often overlook the divergence from the model's top-1 prediction and local correlation between adjacent tokens. In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations. Extensive experiments on the WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.

## 60. Mem2ActBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Long-Term Memory Utilization in Task-Oriented Autonomous Agents
- **Authors**: Yiting Shen , Kun Li , Wei Zhou , Songlin Hu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19935)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed for complex, tool-based tasks where long-term memory is critical to driving actions. Existing benchmarks, however, primarily test a angent's ability to passively retrieve isolated facts in response to explicit questions. They fail to evaluate the more crucial capability of actively applying memory to execute tasks. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{Mem2ActBench}, a benchmark for evaluating whether agents can proactively leverage long-term memory to execute tool-based actions by selecting appropriate tools and grounding their parameters. The benchmark simulates persistent assistant usage, where users mention the same topic across long, interrupted interactions and expect previously established preferences and task states to be implicitly applied. We build the dataset with an automated pipeline that merges heterogeneous sources (ToolACE, BFCL, Oasst1), resolves conflicts via consistency modeling, and synthesizes 2,029 sessions with 12 user--assistant--tool turns on average. From these memory chains, a reverse-generation method produces 400 tool-use tasks, with human evaluation confirming 91.3\% are strongly memory-dependent. Experiments on seven memory frameworks show that current systems remain inadequate at actively utilizing memory for parameter grounding, highlighting the need for more effective approaches to evaluate and improve memory application in task execution.

## 61. Quantifying non deterministic drift in large language models
- **Authors**: Claire Nicholson
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19934](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19934)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for tasks ranging from summarisation to decision support. In practice, identical prompts do not always produce identical outputs, even when temperature and other decoding parameters are fixed. In this work, we conduct repeated-run experiments to empirically quantify baseline behavioural drift, defined as output variability observed when the same prompt is issued multiple times under operator-free conditions. We evaluate two publicly accessible models, gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b, across five prompt categories using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures of 0.0 and 0.7. Drift is measured using unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics, enabling direct comparison across models, prompting modes, and deployment types. The results show that nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with distinct variability patterns by model size, deployment, and prompt type. We situate these findings within existing work on concept drift, behavioural drift, and infrastructure-induced nondeterminism, discuss the limitations of lexical metrics, and highlight emerging semantic approaches. By establishing a systematic empirical baseline in the absence of stabilisation techniques, this study provides a reference point for evaluating future drift mitigation and control methods.

## 62. Text-to-State Mapping for Non-Resolution Reasoning: The Contradiction-Preservation Principle
- **Authors**: Kei Saito
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19933](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19933)
- **Abstract**:
> Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR) provides a formal framework for maintaining semantic ambiguity rather than forcing premature interpretation collapse. While the foundational architecture establishes state spaces and operators for ambiguity-preserving computation, the critical question of how natural language maps to these mathematical structures remains open. This paper introduces the text-to-state mapping function {\phi} that transforms linguistic input into superposition states within the NRR framework. We formalize the Contradiction-Preservation Principle, which requires that genuinely ambiguous expressions maintain non-zero entropy in their state representations, and develop extraction protocols using existing Large Language Models as interpretation generators. Empirical validation across 68 test sentences spanning lexical, structural, and pragmatic ambiguity demonstrates that our mapping achieves mean Shannon entropy H(S) = 1.087 bits for ambiguous inputs while baseline single-interpretation approaches yield H(S) = 0.000. The framework provides the missing algorithmic bridge between raw text and the formal state spaces on which NRR operators act, enabling architectural collapse deferment in language model inference.

- **Authors**: Nora Graichen , Iria de-Dios-Flores , Gemma Boleda
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19926](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19926)
- **Abstract**:
> We present a systematic review of 337 articles evaluating the syntactic abilities of Transformer-based language models, reporting on 1,015 model results from a range of syntactic phenomena and interpretability methods. Our analysis shows that the state of the art presents a healthy variety of methods and data, but an over-focus on a single language (English), a single model (BERT), and phenomena that are easy to get at (like part of speech and agreement). Results also suggest that TLMs capture these form-oriented phenomena well, but show more variable and weaker performance on phenomena at the syntax-semantics interface, like binding or filler-gap dependencies. We provide recommendations for future work, in particular reporting complete data, better aligning theoretical constructs and methods across studies, increasing the use of mechanistic methods, and broadening the empirical scope regarding languages and linguistic phenomena.

## 66. Evaluating Large Language Models for Abstract Evaluation Tasks: An Empirical Study
- **Authors**: Yinuo Liu , Emre Sezgin , Eric A. Youngstrom
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19925](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19925)
- **Abstract**:
> Introduction: Large language models (LLMs) can process requests and generate texts, but their feasibility for assessing complex academic content needs further investigation. To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater. The weaker performance on subjective dimensions indicates that AI should serve a complementary role in evaluation, while human expertise remains essential.

## 67. OPT-Engine: Benchmarking the Limits of LLMs in Optimization Modeling via Complexity Scaling
- **Authors**: Yitian Chen , Cheng Cheng , Yinan Sun , Zi Ling , Dongdong Ge
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19924](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19924)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in optimization modeling, fostering a rapid expansion of new methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. However, the boundaries of their capabilities in automated formulation and problem solving remain poorly understood, particularly when extending to complex, real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark framework designed to evaluate LLMs on optimization modeling with controllable and scalable difficulty levels. OPT-ENGINE spans 10 canonical tasks across operations research, with five Linear Programming and five Mixed-Integer Programming. Utilizing OPT-ENGINE, we conduct an extensive study of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing two critical questions: 1.) Do LLMs' performance remain robust when generalizing to out-of-distribution optimization tasks that scale in complexity beyond current benchmark levels? and 2.) At what stage, from problem interpretation to solution generation, do current LLMs encounter the most significant bottlenecks? Our empirical results yield two key insights: first, tool-integrated reasoning with external solvers exhibits significantly higher robustness as task complexity escalates, while pure-text reasoning reaches a ceiling; second, the automated formulation of constraints constitutes the primary performance bottleneck. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing next-generation LLMs for advanced optimization. Our code is publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{ this https URL }.

## 68. Table-BiEval: A Self-Supervised, Dual-Track Framework for Decoupling Structure and Content in LLM Evaluation
- **Authors**: Boxiang Zhao , Qince Li , Zhonghao Wang , Zelin Cao , Yi Wang , Peng Cheng , Bo Lin
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19923](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19923)
- **Abstract**:
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, the capability to faithfully translate natural language into rigorous structured formats-essential for tool invocation-and to convert complex tabular information into machine-readable specifications has become paramount. However, current evaluations lack effective methodologies to measure this structural fidelity without costly human intervention, as traditional text metrics fail to detect semantic drift in code-like outputs. This paper proposes Table-BiEval, a novel approach based on a human-free, self-supervised evaluation framework, to assess LLMs performance quantitatively. By leveraging deterministic Intermediate Representations, our framework calculates Content Semantic Accuracy and Normalized Tree Edit Distance to decouple structure from content. Also, it empirically evaluates 15 state-of-the-art LLMs across dual topological dimensions-hierarchical structures and flat tables. The results reveal substantial variability, highlighting that mid-sized models can surprisingly outperform larger counterparts in structural efficiency and confirming that deep recursive nesting remains a universal bottleneck for current architectures.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19922](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19922)
- **Abstract**:
> Supportive conversation depends on skills that go beyond language fluency, including reading emotions, adjusting tone, and navigating moments of resistance, frustration, or distress. Despite rapid progress in language models, we still lack a clear way to understand how their abilities in these interpersonal domains compare to those of humans. We introduce HEART, the first-ever framework that directly compares humans and LLMs on the same multi-turn emotional-support conversations. For each dialogue history, we pair human and model responses and evaluate them through blinded human raters and an ensemble of LLM-as-judge evaluators. All assessments follow a rubric grounded in interpersonal communication science across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following. HEART uncovers striking behavioral patterns. Several frontier models approach or surpass the average human responses in perceived empathy and consistency. At the same time, humans maintain advantages in adaptive reframing, tension-naming, and nuanced tone shifts, particularly in adversarial turns. Human and LLM-as-judge preferences align on about 80 percent of pairwise comparisons, matching inter-human agreement, and their written rationales emphasize similar HEART dimensions. This pattern suggests an emerging convergence in the criteria used to assess supportive quality. By placing humans and models on equal footing, HEART reframes supportive dialogue as a distinct capability axis, separable from general reasoning or linguistic fluency. It provides a unified empirical foundation for understanding where model-generated support aligns with human social judgment, where it diverges, and how affective conversational competence scales with model size.

## 70. Demystifying Multi-Agent Debate: The Role of Confidence and Diversity
- **Authors**: Xiaochen Zhu , Caiqi Zhang , Yizhou Chi , Tom Stafford , Nigel Collier , Andreas Vlachos
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19921](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19921)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-agent debate (MAD) is widely used to improve large language model (LLM) performance through test-time scaling, yet recent work shows that vanilla MAD often underperforms simple majority vote despite higher computational cost. Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence. We show theoretically that diversity-aware initialisation improves the prior probability of MAD success without changing the underlying update dynamics, while confidence-modulated updates enable debate to systematically drift to the correct hypothesis. Empirically, across six reasoning-oriented QA benchmarks, our methods consistently outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote. Our results connect human deliberation with LLM-based debate and demonstrate that simple, principled modifications can substantially enhance debate effectiveness.

## 71. Modeling Next-Token Prediction as Left-Nested Intuitionistic Implication
- **Authors**: Paul Tarau
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19915](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19915)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce the \emph{Arrow Language Model}, a neural architecture derived from an intuitionistic-logic interpretation of next-token prediction. Instead of representing tokens as additive embeddings mixed by attention, we encode a prefix as a \emph{left-nested implication chain} whose structure preserves order through non-commutative composition. Next-token prediction corresponds to \emph{modus ponens}, and sequence processing becomes constructive proof extension under the Curry--Howard correspondence. Our Prolog-based specialized theorem provers validate fundamental properties of the neural models, among which relations between commutative vs. non-commutative sequencing and single-token vs. multi-token prediction choices. We show that a neural architecture equivalent to multiplicative RNNs arises naturally from a proof-theoretic interpretation of next-token prediction as nested intuitionistic implication, we present a practical low-rank neural realization and position the model relative to Transformers and state-space models. Keywords: logic-based derivation of neural architectures, intuitionistic implicational logic, token-as-operator neural models, state-space models, alternatives to transformer-based foundational models.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19914](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19914)
- **Abstract**:
> Synthetic data has proven itself to be a valuable resource for tuning smaller, cost-effective language models to handle the complexities of multi-turn tool calling conversations. While many frameworks and systems for producing synthetic multi-turn tool calling data have been proposed, prior works have frequently assumed that any tool calling interactions will take place in an execution environment that maintains state. When such an environment is available, this is advantageous as it allows for the validity of an interaction to be determined by whether or not the state of the execution environment matches to some prespecified objective. Unfortunately, this does not hold in many real-world tool use settings, e.g., in enterprise settings where data security is of the utmost importance or in cases where tool specifications are synthesized from multiple sources. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a data generation method, DiGiT-TC, that is designed to produce tool calling conversations that have the characteristics of conversations generated through search in a stateful environment. The key to our technique lies in a novel generation pattern that allows our approach to implicitly represent certain tool calls in the user request. We validate our approach on standard tool calling benchmarks and demonstrate that, even in stateful problem settings, our approach results in strong performance gains.

## 73. From Intuition to Expertise: Rubric-Based Cognitive Calibration for Human Detection of LLM-Generated Korean Text
- **Authors**: Shinwoo Park , Yo-Sub Han
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19913](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19913)
- **Abstract**:
> Distinguishing human-written Korean text from fluent LLM outputs remains difficult even for linguistically trained readers, who can over-trust surface well-formedness. We study whether expert detection can be treated as a learnable skill and improved through structured calibration. We introduce LREAD, a rubric derived from national Korean writing standards and adapted to target micro-level artifacts (e.g., punctuation optionality, spacing behavior, and register shifts). In a three-phase longitudinal blind protocol with Korean linguistics majors, Phase 1 measures intuition-only detection, Phase 2 enforces criterion-level scoring with explicit justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates domain-focused mastery on held-out elementary essays. Across phases, majority-vote accuracy increases from 60% to 100%, accompanied by stronger inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 --> 0.82). Compared to state-of-the-art LLM detectors, calibrated humans rely more on language-specific micro-diagnostics that are not well captured by coarse discourse priors. Our findings suggest that rubric-scaffolded expert judgment can serve as an interpretable complement to automated detectors for non-English settings, and we release the full rubric and a taxonomy of calibrated detection signatures.

## 74. Analysis of LLM Vulnerability to GPU Soft Errors: An Instruction-Level Fault Injection Study
- **Authors**: Duo Chai , Zizhen Liu , Shuhuai Wang , Songwei Pei , Cheng Liu , Huawei Li , Shangguang Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19912)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) are highly compute- and memory-intensive, posing significant demands on high-performance GPUs. At the same time, advances in GPU technology driven by shrinking transistor sizes and lower operating voltages have made these devices increasingly susceptible to soft errors. While prior work has examined GPU reliability, most studies have focused on general-purpose applications or conventional neural networks mostly used for vision tasks such as classification and detection. In contrast, systematic analysis of modern large-scale LLMs remains limited, despite their rapid adoption in diverse application scenarios. Given the unique characteristics of LLMs, their resilience to soft errors may differ substantially from earlier models. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first instruction-level fault injection study of LLM inference. Our approach reveals reliability characteristics from multiple perspectives, highlighting the effects of model architecture, parameter scale, and task complexity. These findings provide new insights into LLM reliability and inform the design of more effective fault tolerance mechanisms.

- **Authors**: Ziyu Hu , Zhiqing Zhong , Weijian Zheng , Zhijing Ye , Xuwei Tan , Xueru Zhang , Zheng Xie , Rajkumar Kettimuthu , Xiaodong Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19904](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19904)
- **Abstract**:
> The exponential growth of large language models has outpaced the capabilities of traditional CPU and GPU architectures due to the slowdown of Moore's Law. Dataflow AI accelerators present a promising alternative; however, there remains a lack of in-depth performance analysis and standardized benchmarking methodologies for LLM training. We introduce DABench-LLM, the first benchmarking framework designed for evaluating LLM workloads on dataflow-based accelerators. By combining intra-chip performance profiling and inter-chip scalability analysis, DABench-LLM enables comprehensive evaluation across key metrics such as resource allocation, load balance, and resource efficiency. The framework helps researchers rapidly gain insights into underlying hardware and system behaviors, and provides guidance for performance optimizations. We validate DABench-LLM on three commodity dataflow accelerators, Cerebras WSE-2, SambaNova RDU, and Graphcore IPU. Our framework reveals performance bottlenecks and provides specific optimization strategies, demonstrating its generality and effectiveness across a diverse range of dataflow-based AI hardware platforms.

## 76. STELLAR: Structure-guided LLM Assertion Retrieval and Generation for Formal Verification
- **Authors**: Saeid Rajabi , Chengmo Yang , Satwik Patnaik
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19903](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19903)
- **Abstract**:
> Formal Verification (FV) relies on high-quality SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs), but the manual writing process is slow and error-prone. Existing LLM-based approaches either generate assertions from scratch or ignore structural patterns in hardware designs and expert-crafted assertions. This paper presents STELLAR, the first framework that guides LLM-based SVA generation with structural similarity. STELLAR represents RTL blocks as AST structural fingerprints, retrieves structurally relevant (RTL, SVA) pairs from a knowledge base, and integrates them into structure-guided prompts. Experiments show that STELLAR achieves superior syntax correctness, stylistic alignment, and functional correctness, highlighting structure-aware retrieval as a promising direction for industrial FV.
