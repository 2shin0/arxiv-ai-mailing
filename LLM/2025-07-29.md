- **Authors**: Huan-ang Gao, Jiayi Geng, Wenyue Hua, Mengkang Hu, Xinzhe Juan, Hongzhang Liu, Shilong Liu, Jiahao Qiu, Xuan Qi, Yiran Wu, Hongru Wang, Han Xiao, Yuhang Zhou, Shaokun Zhang, Jiayi Zhang, Jinyu Xiang, Yixiong Fang, Qiwen Zhao, Dongrui Liu, Qihan Ren, Cheng Qian, Zhenghailong Wang, Minda Hu, Huazheng Wang, Qingyun Wu, Heng Ji, Mengdi Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21046](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21046)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously, performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

## 2. GenoMAS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Scientific Discovery via Code-Driven Gene Expression Analysis
- **Authors**: Haoyang Liu, Yijiang Li, Haohan Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21035](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21035)
- **Abstract**:
> Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry. GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack, thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
> On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85% respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting for latent confounders. Code is available at this https URL.

## 3. MIRAGE-Bench: LLM Agent is Hallucinating and Where to Find Them
- **Authors**: Weichen Zhang, Yiyou Sun, Pohao Huang, Jiayue Pu, Heyue Lin, Dawn Song
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21017](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21017)
- **Abstract**:
> Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii) environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

## 4. Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents
- **Authors**: Aran Nayebi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate* utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness, low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step, self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal, the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF, which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs. Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

## 5. On the Limits of Hierarchically Embedded Logic in Classical Neural Networks
- **Authors**: Bill Cochran
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20960](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20960)
- **Abstract**:
> We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness. This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination, repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in future development of language models.

## 6. MMGraphRAG: Bridging Vision and Language with Interpretable Multimodal Knowledge Graphs
- **Authors**: Xueyao Wan, Hang Yu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20804](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20804)
- **Abstract**:
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However, conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information. Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets, demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

## 7. evalSmarT: An LLM-Based Framework for Evaluating Smart Contract Generated Comments
- **Authors**: Fatou Ndiaye Mbodji
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20774](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20774)
- **Abstract**:
> Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However, evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present \texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies. We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing methods.

## 8. Enhancing Large Multimodal Models with Adaptive Sparsity and KV Cache Compression
- **Authors**: Te Zhang, Yuheng Li, Junxiang Wang, Lujun Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20613](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20613)
- **Abstract**:
> Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency. Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers, using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and 13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing much performance.

## 9. MeLA: A Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture for Automatic Heuristic Design
- **Authors**: Zishang Qiu, Xinan Chen, Long Chen, Ruibin Bai
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20541)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

## 10. Security Challenges in AI Agent Deployment: Insights from a Large Scale Public Competition
- **Authors**: Andy Zou, Maxwell Lin, Eliot Jones, Micha Nowak, Mateusz Dziemian, Nick Winter, Alexander Grattan, Valent Nathanael, Ayla Croft, Xander Davies, Jai Patel, Robert Kirk, Nate Burnikell, Yarin Gal, Dan Hendrycks, J. Zico Kolter, Matt Fredrikson
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20526](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20526)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming (ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across 19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent deployment.

## 11. Memorization in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Danil Savine, Muni Sreenivas Pydi, Jamal Atif, Olivier Cappé
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21009](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21009)
- **Abstract**:
> This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data, using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
> Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning.
> Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3) Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns at higher ranks.
> These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large language models while managing data privacy concerns.

## 12. Security Tensors as a Cross-Modal Bridge: Extending Text-Aligned Safety to Vision in LVLM
- **Authors**: Shen Li, Liuyi Yao, Wujia Niu, Lan Zhang, Yaliang Li
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20994](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20994)
- **Abstract**:
> Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models (LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii) general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs, thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

## 13. SmallThinker: A Family of Efficient Large Language Models Natively Trained for Local Deployment
- **Authors**: Yixin Song, Zhenliang Xue, Dongliang Wei, Feiyang Chen, Jianxiang Gao, Junchen Liu, Hangyu Liang, Guangshuo Qin, Chengrong Tian, Bo Wen, Longyu Zhao, Xinrui Zheng, Zeyu Mi, Haibo Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20984](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20984)
- **Abstract**:
> While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices: weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at this http URL and this http URL.

## 14. Your AI, Not Your View: The Bias of LLMs in Investment Analysis
- **Authors**: Hoyoung Lee, Junhyuk Seo, Suhwan Park, Junhyeong Lee, Wonbin Ahn, Chanyeol Choi, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, Yongjae Lee
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20957](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20957)
- **Abstract**:
> In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

## 15. Mind the Gap: Conformative Decoding to Improve Output Diversity of Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Max Peeperkorn, Tom Kouwenhoven, Dan Brown, Anna Jordanous
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20956](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20956)
- **Abstract**:
> Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings, we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and even maintains or improves quality.

## 16. Dissecting Persona-Driven Reasoning in Language Models via Activation Patching
- **Authors**: Ansh Poonia, Maeghal Jain
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20936)
- **Abstract**:
> Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and color-based identities.

## 17. FRED: Financial Retrieval-Enhanced Detection and Editing of Hallucinations in Language Models
- **Authors**: Likun Tan, Kuan-Wei Huang, Kevin Wu
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20930](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20930)
- **Abstract**:
> Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4, Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8% improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2% drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and data are available at this https URL.

## 18. FHSTP@EXIST 2025 Benchmark: Sexism Detection with Transparent Speech Concept Bottleneck Models
- **Authors**: Roberto Labadie-Tamayo, Adrian Jaques Böck, Djordje Slijepčević, Xihui Chen, Andreas Babic, Matthias Zeppelzauer
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20924](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20924)
- **Abstract**:
> Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks (EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask 1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks. SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles, can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

## 19. Pareto-Grid-Guided Large Language Models for Fast and High-Quality Heuristics Design in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization
- **Authors**: Minh Hieu Ha, Hung Phan, Tung Duy Doan, Tung Dao, Dao Tran, Huynh Thi Thanh Binh
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20923](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20923)
- **Abstract**:
> Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime. Our code is available at: this https URL.

## 20. MediQAl: A French Medical Question Answering Dataset for Knowledge and Reasoning Evaluation
- **Authors**: Adrien Bazoge
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20917](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20917)
- **Abstract**:
> This work introduces MediQAl, a French medical question answering dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models in factual medical recall and reasoning over real-world clinical scenarios. MediQAl contains 32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii) Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with 14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.

## 21. HAMLET-FFD: Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning Embeddings Transformation for Face Forgery Detection
- **Authors**: Jialei Cui, Jianwei Du, Yanzhe Li, Lei Gao, Hui Jiang, Chenfu Bao
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20913](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20913)
- **Abstract**:
> The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

## 22. Music Arena: Live Evaluation for Text-to-Music
- **Authors**: Yonghyun Kim, Wayne Chi, Anastasios N. Angelopoulos, Wei-Lin Chiang, Koichi Saito, Shinji Watanabe, Yuki Mitsufuji, Chris Donahue
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20900](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20900)
- **Abstract**:
> We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems, and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed* preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency. Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies, and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

## 23. Aligning Large Language Model Agents with Rational and Moral Preferences: A Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach
- **Authors**: Wei Lu, Daniel L. Chen, Christian B. Hansen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20796](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20796)
- **Abstract**:
> Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis). We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.

## 24. Text2VLM: Adapting Text-Only Datasets to Evaluate Alignment Training in Visual Language Models
- **Authors**: Gabriel Downer, Sean Craven, Damian Ruck, Jake Thomas
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20704](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20704)
- **Abstract**:
> The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities, Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse, real-world applications.

## 25. MIMII-Agent: Leveraging LLMs with Function Calling for Relative Evaluation of Anomalous Sound Detection
- **Authors**: Harsh Purohit, Tomoya Nishida, Kota Dohi, Takashi Endo, Yohei Kawaguchi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20666](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20666)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper proposes a method for generating machine-type-specific anomalies to evaluate the relative performance of unsupervised anomalous sound detection (UASD) systems across different machine types, even in the absence of real anomaly sound data. Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels, limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions, converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds. We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data. Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.

## 26. Ontology-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Completion using Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Wenbin Guo, Xin Wang, Jiaoyan Chen, Zhao Li, Zirui Chen
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20643](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20643)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

## 27. TransPrune: Token Transition Pruning for Efficient Large Vision-Language Model
- **Authors**: Ao Li, Yuxiang Duan, Jinghui Zhang, Congbo Ma, Yutong Xie, Gustavo Carneiro, Mohammad Yaqub, Hu Wang
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20630](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20630)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens, motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method. Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention, achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at this https URL.

## 28. Beyond Interactions: Node-Level Graph Generation for Knowledge-Free Augmentation in Recommender Systems
- **Authors**: Zhaoyan Wang, Hyunjun Ahn, In-Young Ko
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20578](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20578)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as knowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which limit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and computational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5 over selected baselines.

## 29. Enhancing Hallucination Detection via Future Context
- **Authors**: Joosung Lee, Cheonbok Park, Hwiyeol Jo, Jeonghoon Kim, Joonsuk Park, Kang Min Yoo
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20546)
- **Abstract**:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to generate plausible text on online platforms, without revealing the generation process. As users increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

## 30. T2I-Copilot: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Text-to-Image System for Enhanced Prompt Interpretation and Interactive Generation
- **Authors**: Chieh-Yun Chen, Min Shi, Gong Zhang, Humphrey Shi
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20536](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20536)
- **Abstract**:
> Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings, denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20534](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20534)
- **Abstract**:
> We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.
> Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering and agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to facilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.

## 32. Enhancing Spatial Reasoning through Visual and Textual Thinking
- **Authors**: Xun Liang, Xin Guo, Zhongming Jin, Weihang Pan, Penghui Shang, Deng Cai, Binbin Lin, Jieping Ye
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20529](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20529)
- **Abstract**:
> The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in 2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

## 33. The Xeno Sutra: Can Meaning and Value be Ascribed to an AI-Generated "Sacred" Text?
- **Authors**: Murray Shanahan, Tara Das, Robert Thurman
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20525](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20525)
- **Abstract**:
> This paper presents a case study in the use of a large language model to generate a fictional Buddhist "sutr"', and offers a detailed analysis of the resulting text from a philosophical and literary point of view. The conceptual subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin. This raises questions about how we, as a society, should come to terms with the potentially unsettling possibility of a technology that encroaches on human meaning-making. We suggest that Buddhist philosophy, by its very nature, is well placed to adapt.

- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20520](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20520)
- **Abstract**:
> Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks, inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies, and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

## 35. LLMs-guided adaptive compensator: Bringing Adaptivity to Automatic Control Systems with Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Zhongchao Zhou, Yuxi Lu, Yaonan Zhu, Yifan Zhao, Bin He, Liang He, Wenwen Yu, Yusuke Iwasawa
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20509)
- **Abstract**:
> With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control, this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead, the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity. Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability, adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and practicality compared to vision-language models.

## 36. Speaking in Words, Thinking in Logic: A Dual-Process Framework in QA Systems
- **Authors**: Tuan Bui, Trong Le, Phat Thai, Sang Nguyen, Minh Hua, Ngan Pham, Thang Bui, Tho Quan
- **URL**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20491](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20491)
- **Abstract**:
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts. However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law, users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating natural language into formal logic representations.
> To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
> Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.
